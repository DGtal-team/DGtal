DGtal is a generic open source library for Digital Geometry programming for which the main objective is to structure different developments from the digital geometry and topology community. The aims are numerous: make easier the appropriation of our tools for a neophyte (new PhD students, researchers from other topics, …), permit better comparisons from new methods with already existing approaches and to construct a federative project. Another objective of DGtal is to simplify the construction of demonstration tools to share new results and potential efficiency of the proposed work.
