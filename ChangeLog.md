# DGtal 0.9

## New Features / Critical Changes
- *Geometry Package*

- New segment computer allowing the recognition of thick digital segments,
  adapted to noisy contours (from a given thickness parameter). The current
  implementation (mainly a backport from imagene) is a model of
  CForwardSegmentComputer with a ParallelStrip primitive. This primitive is
  similar to the blurred segment of [Debled-Rennesson etal 2005] with isothetic
  thickness. It is also an implementation of the alpha-thick segment of Alexandre
  Faure and Fabien Feschet.
  (Bertrand Kerautret,  [#963](https://github.com/DGtal-team/DGtal/pull/963))


- *Configuration/General*
  - Continuous integration enabled on both linux and macosx

  - Documentation added for Catch. (David Coeurjolly,
   [#1042](https://github.com/DGtal-team/DGtal/pull/1042))


- *Kernel*
  - New template class DigitalSetlByAssociativeContainer allows to
   define digital sets from any associative container of the STL. For
   instance, using std::unordered_set (c++11) or boost::unordered_set (hash
   function based containers), speed-up up to 40% can be measured when
   processing digital sets. (David Coeurjolly,
   [#1023](https://github.com/DGtal-team/DGtal/pull/1023)
  - By default, Z2i::DigitalSet, Z3i::DigitalSet and digital set from
   DigitalSetSelector use the new hash function based
   container. (David Coeurjolly,
   [#1023](https://github.com/DGtal-team/DGtal/pull/1023)
  - Specializations of std::hash (c++11) and boost::hash to define a hash
   functions on DGtal points. (David Coeurjolly,

# DGtal 0.8


## New Features / Critical Changes

- *General*
  - This Changelog has been ported to MarkDown (David Coeurjolly,
   [#846](https://github.com/DGtal-team/DGtal/pull/846))
  - The DGtal main website is now http://dgtal.org

 - Global refactoring of base functors (David Coeurjolly,
   [#861](https://github.com/DGtal-team/DGtal/pull/861))
    - BasicFunctor functors have been moved to functors:: namespace.
    - DefaultFunctor has been renamed functors::Identity.
    - xxxFunctor have been renamed to xxx.

  - Moving graph, topology, geometry/estimation concepts into
   namespace concepts::, also moving some functors into namespace
   functors:: (Jacques-Olivier Lachaud,
   [#912](https://github.com/DGtal-team/DGtal/pull/912)).

- *DEC Package*
  - DGtal 0.8 contains the first release of the Discrete Exterior
   Calculus Package. DEC provides an easy and efficient way to
   describe linear operator over various structure. Basic operators,
   such as Hodge duality operator or exterior derivative, can be
   combined to create classical vector analysis operator such as
   gradient, curl and divergence. (Pierre Gueth,
   [#877](https://github.com/DGtal-team/DGtal/pull/877))


- *Geometry Package*
  - Add digital nD Voronoi Covariance Measure support, as well as
  digital geometric estimators based on it. Add tests and examples of
  feature detection with VCM. (Jacques-Olivier Lachaud,
  [#803](https://github.com/DGtal-team/DGtal/pull/803))

  - Add Integral Invariant estimators so that they meet the concept of
  surface local estimator. Add geometric functors to define easily all
  the geometric estimators that can be built from the volume and
  coariance matrix. Previous estimators (IntegralInvariantMeanCurvatureEstimator
  and IntegralInvariantGaussianCurvatureEstimator) are removed. Please use
  the new ones instead. (Jeremy Levallois, Jacques-Olivier Lachaud,
  [#803](https://github.com/DGtal-team/DGtal/pull/803)
  [#856](https://github.com/DGtal-team/DGtal/pull/856)
  [#893](https://github.com/DGtal-team/DGtal/pull/893))

  - Various geometric predicates are now available in order to test the
  orientation of three points in the planes. Most classes are template
  classes parametrized by a type for the points (or its coordinates)
  and an integral type for the computations. They always return an
  exact value (or sign), provided that the integral type used for the
  computations is well chosen with respect to the coordinates of the
  points. Some implementations do not increase the size of the input
  integers during the computations. (Tristan Roussillon,
  [#755](https://github.com/DGtal-team/DGtal/pull/755))

  - Logarithmic construction of an arithmetical DSS of minimal
   parameters from a bounding DSL and two end points (ctor of
   ArithmeticalDSS) (Tristan Roussillon,
   [#819](https://github.com/DGtal-team/DGtal/pull/819))

  - Proof-of-concept that path-based norms can be implemented in a
   separable approach using logarithmic cost predicates
   (experimental::ChamferNorm2D). (David Coeurjolly,
   [#898](https://github.com/DGtal-team/DGtal/pull/898))

  - Logarithmic construction of an arithmetical DSS of minimal
   parameters from a bounding DSS (of known leaning points)
   and two end points (ctor of
    ArithmeticalDSS) (Tristan Roussillon,
    [#914](https://github.com/DGtal-team/DGtal/pull/914))

  - Feature extraction algorithm from Tensor Voting.(Jérémy Levallois,
   David Coeurjolly,
   [#895](https://github.com/DGtal-team/DGtal/pull/895))

   usage of Center-(X,Y,Z) parameters, as described in Vol file
   specification. (Jérémy Levallois,
   [#879](https://github.com/DGtal-team/DGtal/pull/879))

=== DGtal 0.7 ===

*General*

  - Unit tests build is now disabled by default (to turn it on, run cmake with "-DBUILD_TESTING=on")

  - The "boost program option library" dependency was removed.

  - DGtal needs boost >= 1.46.

  - Thanks to new compiler warning option (-Wdocumentation), the doxygen documentation has been considerably improved.

*Base Package*

  - Complete rewriting of Clone, Alias and ConstAlias
    classes. Parameter passing is now documented with a standardized
    method to determine parameters unambiguously. Associated classed
    CowPtr, CountedPtrOrPtr and CountedConstPtrOrConstPtr are now used
    in conjunction with the previous classes.

  - Few improvments in Clock and Trace base classes.

*Kernel Package*

  - Two initialisation methods (initRemoveOneDim and initAddOneDim)
    for the Projector Functor from the BasicPointFunctors class in
    order to simplify the slice images (with example and test in 2D
    slice image extraction from 3D volume file).

  - New basic functors:
  - SliceRotator2D: to rotate 2D Slice images from 3D volume.
  - Point2DEmbedderIn3D: a simple functor to embed in 3d a 2d points
    (useful to extract 2D image from 3D volume).

  - Sets have been updated to own their domain with a copy-on-write pointer,
    in order to avoid some inconsistencies.

*Topology Package*

  - Fixing bugs in Object::isSimple for some digital
    topologies. Speed of Object::isSimple has been improved. Homotopic
    thinning is much faster (even without a precomputed simplicity
    table).

  - Objects have been updated to use Clone services.

*Geometry Package*

  - New classes to deal with arithmetical digital straight segments.
    Now the representation of the primitives and their recognition
    along a discrete structure are separated. The unique class
    ArithmeticalDSS,  which was a segment computer, has been replaced by
    mainly three classes: ArithmeticalDSL, ArithmeticalDSS and
    ArithmeticalDSSComputer. This is described in a doc page of the geometry
    package. Note that Backward/Forward suffixes have been renamed into
    Back/Front. Moreover, get prefixes for data members accessors have been
    removed.

  - Generic adapter to transform a metric (model of CMetric) with
    monotonic (see doc) properties to a separable metric (model of
    CSeparableMetric) which can be used in
    VoronoiMap/DistanceTransformation algorithms.

  - New possibility to access the 3 2D ArithmeticDSS object within an
    ArithmeticDSS3d.

  - New local estimator adapter to make easy implementation of locally defined
    differential estimator on digital surfaces.

  - New documentation on local estimators from digital surface
    patches and surfel functors. New normal vector estimator from
    weighted sum of elementary surfel normal vectors added.

  - With an optional binding with CGAL and Eigen3, new curvature and
    normal vector estimators have been added. For instance, you can
    now estimate curvature from polynomial surface fitting (Jet
    Fitting) and Monge forms.

  - Minor improvements in the spherical accumulator.

  - Improvement of integral invariant estimators (better memory footprint,
    ...).
    They also allow to estimate principal curvatures using Covariance matrix.
    Covariance matrix is also "masks" based, so the computation is efficient.

  - New algorithms to compute the minimal characteristics of a
    Digital Straight Line subsegment in logarithmic time using local
    convex hulls or Farey Fan. Also works when the DSL
    characteristics are not integers.

  - Chord algorithm for (naive) plane recognition and width computation.

  - New organization for computing primitives. Introduction of the concept
    of PrimitiveComputer and specialization. COBA algorithm and Chord
    algorithm are now models of AdditivePrimitiveComputer.

  - Introduction of the primitive ParallelStrip, computed by COBA and Chord
    algorithms

  - New documentation for planarity decision, plane recognition and width
    computation.
    Quantitative and qualitative evaluation of COBA and Chord algorithm.

  - Bug fix in COBA algorithm when extending an empty computer with a group of
    points.

  - add standard plane recognition with adapter classes both for COBA and
    Chord algorithm.

*Shape Package*

  - The class MeshFromPoints was transformed into Mesh (more from
    shapes/fromPoints to shapes/ directory), iterators on mesh
    points and mesh face.

*Topology Package*

  - The class SCellToMidPoint is now deprecated. Use CanonicSCellEmbedder
    instead to map a signed cell to its corresponding point in the Euclidean
    space

*IO Package*

  - Complete refactoring of 3D viewers and boards (Viewer3D, Board3DTo2D).
  - New Board3D to export 3D displays to OBJ 3D vector format.
  - A new display of 2D and 3D image in Viewer3D.
  - New reader: HDF5 file with 2D image dataset(s) (8-bit with palette and
    24-bit truecolor with INTERLACE_PIXEL).
  - New GenericReader and Generic Writer for both 2D, 3D and ND images.
  - Adding a Table Reader to extract objets given in a specific column from a
    text file.
  - Adding missing PPM Reader.
  - Adding missing DICOM reader (with ITK library)
  - Adding ITK reader and ITK writer
  - OpenInventor (SOQT/Coin3D) based viewer has been removed (please consider
    release <=0.6 if interested).

*Image Package*

  - New concepts : CImageFactory to define the concept describing an
    image factory and CImageCacheReadPolicy/CImageCacheWritePolicy
    to define the concept describing cache read/write policies.

  - New classes : ImageFactoryFromImage to implement a factory to
    produce images from a "bigger/original" one according to a given
    domain, ImageCache to implement an images cache with 'read and
    write' policies, TiledImageFromImage to implement a tiled image
    from a "bigger/original" one.

  - ImageContainerByITKImage complies with CImage.
    The container has been moved from the DGtal::experimental namespace to
    the main DGtal namespace.

*Graph Package*

  - New graph visitor, which allows to visit a graph according to
    any distance object (like the Euclidean distance to some point).

*Math Package*

  - add Histogram class and CBinner concept.
  - add math concepts diagram.

    displayed and html reference pages are pointed.
  - package/module documentation files are now in their associated
    package folder (e.g. kernel/doc/ for kernel package related
    documentation pages). The "make doc" command (or "make dox", see
    below) generates the documentation in the "html/" sub-folder of your
    current build folder.
  - latex citations within doxygen documents are now working

 *Base Package*
  - correct concept checks for some range concepts.
  - Statistic class moved to math package

 *Kernel Package*

    container models

 *Geometry Package*
  - New primitives for digital plane recognition. Naive planes, and
    more generally planes with arbitrary axis-width can be detected

    implementation, which uses 2D lattice polytopes.
  - Fréchet segment computer added to compute bounded simplifications of
    digital curves for instance.
  - Complete rewritting of volumetric tools by separable processes:

=== DGtal 0.5 ===
Posted on May, 9th, 2012 by David Coeurjolly

Many changes have been pushed to this release with a lot of nice
tools.  Before going into details component by component, we would
like to focus on a couple of new cool features:

  - new arithmetic package (fractions, models of fraction,
  Stern-Brocot, continued fraction,...)
  - new nD DigitalSurface model (collections of (n-1) topological cells
  with many tools/utilities to track surface elements)
  - update of the build system to make easier the use of DGtal in your
  projects.
  - DGtal and DGtalTools
  - many bugfixes..

* Overall  Project

  - In previous DGtal releases, tools were given in the source
  "tools/" folder. In this release, we have chosen to move the
  tools to another GitHub project
  (http://github.com/DGtal-team/DGtalTools) with a specific
  development process. Please have a look to this project to get
  nice tools built upon the DGtal library.

  - cmake scripts and DGtalConfig have been widely updated to make
  easier the use of the library in your own code

  - We are debugging both the code and the scripts to make it compile
  on windows. We still have couple of issues but most of DGtal
  compiles.

  - Again, efforts have been done on the documentation.


* Package Topology:

 - Creation of the graph concept (see Doxygen documentation)

 - Graph tools have been added: breadth first visitor for any model of
   graph

 - Creation of high-level classes to represent several kinds of
   digital surfaces. Surfaces are n-1 dimensional objetcs and may be
   open or closed. There are several models of digital surface
   containers: boundary of a set of points, explicit set of surfels,
   boundary of a digital object defined by a predicate, frontier
   between two regions, light containers that are discovered on
   traversal but not stored explicitly, etc.

 - All these digital surfaces can be manipulated through the same
   object (DigitalSurface), whichever the container.

 - DigitalSurface is a model of a graph whose vertices are the surfels
   and whose arcs are the connections between surfels.

 - Definition of umbrellas over digital surfaces, that forms faces on
   the surface graph.

 - In 3D, digital surface form combinatorial 2-manifolds with boundary

 - Digital surface can be exported in OFF format

 - Several examples using digital surfaces are provided, like
   extracting isosurfaces from images or volume files defining
   surfaces in labelled images.

* Package Algebraic (new package)

 - Definition of n-variate polynomial as a one-dimensional polynomial
   whose coefficients are n-1-variate polynomials. Coefficient ring
   and dimension are templated.

 - Creation of a reader that can transform a string representation of
   multivariate polynomial into such polynomial object. Use
   boost::spirit.

 - Example using package Topology to extract and display implicit
   polynomial surfaces in 3D.

* Package Arithmetic (new package)

 - Standard arithmetic computations are provided: greatest common
   divisor, Bézout vectors, continued fractions,  convergent.

 - Several representations of irreducible fractions are provided. They
   are based on the Stern-Brocot tree structure. With these fractions,
   amortized constant time operations are provided for computing
   reduced fractions.

 - An implementation of patterns and subpatterns is provided, based on
   the irreducible fractions.
 - A representation of digital standard line in the first quadrant is
   provided, as well as fast algorithms to recognize digital straight
   subsegments.


* Package Image

  - Complete refactoring of Images and ImageContainers (more
  consistent design)

  - Documentation added

  - Graph of concepts added in the documentation


* Package Geometry

  - New SegmentComputer (a.k.a. geometrical primitives to use for
  recognition, curve decomposition,...) : ArithDSS3D (3D DSS), DCA
  (Digital Circular Arcs), CombinatorialDSSS, ...

  - New normal vector field estimation based on elementary normal
  vector convolution in n-D

  - Distance Transformation by Fast Marching Method added.

* Package IO

  - Complete refactoring of the way a DGtal object is displayed in
  boards/viewers.

  - New 2D board  backend: you can export your drawning in TikZ for
  latex includes.


=== DGtal 0.4 ===
Posted on September 26, 2011 by David Coeurjolly

  * Global changes:
     - A better decomposition of DGtal algorithms and
       data structures into packages.
     - By default, DGtal is built with minimal dependencies.
     - Concepts and concept checking mechanism have been
       considerably improved.

  * Kernel Package: refactoring of Integer types considered in
    DGtal.

  * Topology Package: Interpixel/cellular topological model,
    boundary tracking tools, ...

      multi-modal representation of 1D contours and curves (GridCurve facade),
      decomposition/segmentation into primitives, many differential
      estimators added, helpers for multigrid comparison of estimators
    - multigrid digital set generators from implicit and parametric
      shapes in dimension 2.

  * I/O Package: refactoring/enhancements of DGtal boards and
    viewers,  enhancement of 2D boards with libcairo and a new
    Board3Dto2D board has been added.


  * Tools: multigrid shapeGenerator/contourGenerator added,
    lengthEstimator/estimatorComparator  added for differential
    estimator multigrid comparison, connected components extraction in
    3D, ...
