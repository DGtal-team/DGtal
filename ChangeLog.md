# DGtal 0.8


## New Features / Critical Changes

- *General*
 - This Changelog has been ported to MarkDown (David Coeurjolly,
   [#846](https://github.com/DGtal-team/DGtal/pull/846))
 - The DGtal main website is now http://dgtal.org

 - Global refactoring of base functors (David Coeurjolly,
   [#861](https://github.com/DGtal-team/DGtal/pull/861))
    - BasicFunctor functors have been moved to functors:: namespace.
    - DefaultFunctor has been renamed functors::Identity.
    - xxxFunctor have been renamed to xxx.

 - Moving graph, topology, geometry/estimation concepts into
   namespace concepts::, also moving some functors into namespace
   functors:: (Jacques-Olivier Lachaud,
   [#912](https://github.com/DGtal-team/DGtal/pull/912)).

- *DEC Package*
 - DGtal 0.8 contains the first release of the Discrete Exterior
   Calculus Package. DEC provides an easy and efficient way to
   describe linear operator over various structure. Basic operators,
   such as Hodge duality operator or exterior derivative, can be
   combined to create classical vector analysis operator such as
   gradient, curl and divergence. (Pierre Gueth,
   [#877](https://github.com/DGtal-team/DGtal/pull/877))


- *Geometry Package*
 - Add digital nD Voronoi Covariance Measure support, as well as
  digital geometric estimators based on it. Add tests and examples of
  feature detection with VCM. (Jacques-Olivier Lachaud,

 - Add Integral Invariant estimators so that they meet the concept of
  surface local estimator. Add geometric functors to define easily all
  the geometric estimators that can be built from the volume and
  coariance matrix. Previous estimators (IntegralInvariantMeanCurvatureEstimator
  and IntegralInvariantGaussianCurvatureEstimator) are removed. Please use
  the new ones instead. (Jeremy Levallois, Jacques-Olivier Lachaud,

 - Various geometric predicates are now available in order to test the
  orientation of three points in the planes. Most classes are template
  classes parametrized by a type for the points (or its coordinates)
  and an integral type for the computations. They always return an
  exact value (or sign), provided that the integral type used for the
  computations is well chosen with respect to the coordinates of the
  points. Some implementations do not increase the size of the input
  integers during the computations. (Tristan Roussillon,
  [#755](https://github.com/DGtal-team/DGtal/pull/755))

   separable approach using logarithmic cost predicates
   (experimental::ChamferNorm2D). (David Coeurjolly,
   [#898](https://github.com/DGtal-team/DGtal/pull/898))

    - Objects have been updated to use Clone services.

*Geometry Package*

    - New classes to deal with arithmetical digital straight segments.
      Now the representation of the primitives and their recognition
      along a discrete structure are separated. The unique class ArithmeticalDSS,
      which was a segment computer, has been replaced by mainly three classes:
      ArithmeticalDSL, ArithmeticalDSS and ArithmeticalDSSComputer.
      This is described in a doc page of the geometry package.
      Note that Backward/Forward suffixes have been renamed into Back/Front.
      Moreover, get prefixes for data members accessors have been removed.

    - Generic adapter to transform a metric (model of CMetric) with
      monotonic (see doc) properties to a separable metric (model of
      CSeparableMetric) which can be used in
      VoronoiMap/DistanceTransformation algorithms.

    - New possibility to access the 3 2D ArithmeticDSS object within an
      ArithmeticDSS3d.

    - New local estimator adapter to make easy implementation of locally defined differential
      estimator on digital surfaces.

    - New documentation on local estimators from digital surface
      patches and surfel functors. New normal vector estimator from
      weighted sum of elementary surfel normal vectors added.

    - With an optional binding with CGAL and Eigen3, new curvature and
      normal vector estimators have been added. For instance, you can
      now estimate curvature from polynomial surface fitting (Jet
      Fitting) and Monge forms.

    - Minor improvements in the spherical accumulator.

    - Improvement of integral invariant estimators (better memory footprint, ...).
      They also allow to estimate principal curvatures using Covariance matrix.
      Covariance matrix is also "masks" based, so the computation is efficient.

    - New algorithms to compute the minimal characteristics of a
      Digital Straight Line subsegment in logarithmic time using local
      convex hulls or Farey Fan. Also works when the DSL
      characteristics are not integers.

    - Chord algorithm for (naive) plane recognition and width computation.

    - New organization for computing primitives. Introduction of the concept
      of PrimitiveComputer and specialization. COBA algorithm and Chord algorithm
      are now models of AdditivePrimitiveComputer.

    - Introduction of the primitive ParallelStrip, computed by COBA and Chord algorithms

    - New documentation for planarity decision, plane recognition and width computation.
      Quantitative and qualitative evaluation of COBA and Chord algorithm.

    - Bug fix in COBA algorithm when extending an empty computer with a group of points.

    - add standard plane recognition with adapter classes both for COBA and Chord algorithm.

      shapes/fromPoints to shapes/ directory), iterators on mesh
      points and mesh face.

=== DGtal 0.5 ===
Posted on May, 9th, 2012 by David Coeurjolly

Many changes have been pushed to this release with a lot of nice
tools.  Before going into details component by component, we would
like to focus on a couple of new cool features:

  - new arithmetic package (fractions, models of fraction,
    Stern-Brocot, continued fraction,...)
  - new nD DigitalSurface model (collections of (n-1) topological cells
    with many tools/utilities to track surface elements)
  - update of the build system to make easier the use of DGtal in your
    projects.
  - DGtal and DGtalTools
  - many bugfixes..

* Overall  Project

  - In previous DGtal releases, tools were given in the source
    "tools/" folder. In this release, we have chosen to move the
    tools to another GitHub project
    (http://github.com/DGtal-team/DGtalTools) with a specific
    development process. Please have a look to this project to get
    nice tools built upon the DGtal library.

  - cmake scripts and DGtalConfig have been widely updated to make
    easier the use of the library in your own code

  - We are debugging both the code and the scripts to make it compile
    on windows. We still have couple of issues but most of DGtal
    compiles.

  - Again, efforts have been done on the documentation.


* Package Topology:

 - Creation of the graph concept (see Doxygen documentation)

 - Graph tools have been added: breadth first visitor for any model of
   graph

 - Creation of high-level classes to represent several kinds of
   digital surfaces. Surfaces are n-1 dimensional objetcs and may be
   open or closed. There are several models of digital surface
   containers: boundary of a set of points, explicit set of surfels,
   boundary of a digital object defined by a predicate, frontier
   between two regions, light containers that are discovered on
   traversal but not stored explicitly, etc.

 - All these digital surfaces can be manipulated through the same
   object (DigitalSurface), whichever the container.

 - DigitalSurface is a model of a graph whose vertices are the surfels
   and whose arcs are the connections between surfels.

 - Definition of umbrellas over digital surfaces, that forms faces on
   the surface graph.

 - In 3D, digital surface form combinatorial 2-manifolds with boundary

 - Digital surface can be exported in OFF format

 - Several examples using digital surfaces are provided, like
   extracting isosurfaces from images or volume files defining
   surfaces in labelled images.

* Package Algebraic (new package)

 - Definition of n-variate polynomial as a one-dimensional polynomial
   whose coefficients are n-1-variate polynomials. Coefficient ring
   and dimension are templated.

 - Creation of a reader that can transform a string representation of
   multivariate polynomial into such polynomial object. Use
   boost::spirit.

 - Example using package Topology to extract and display implicit
   polynomial surfaces in 3D.

* Package Arithmetic (new package)

 - Standard arithmetic computations are provided: greatest common
   divisor, Bézout vectors, continued fractions,  convergent.

 - Several representations of irreducible fractions are provided. They
   are based on the Stern-Brocot tree structure. With these fractions,
   amortized constant time operations are provided for computing
   reduced fractions.

 - An implementation of patterns and subpatterns is provided, based on
   the irreducible fractions.
 - A representation of digital standard line in the first quadrant is
   provided, as well as fast algorithms to recognize digital straight
   subsegments.


* Package Image

  - Complete refactoring of Images and ImageContainers (more
    consistent design)

  - Documentation added

  - Graph of concepts added in the documentation


* Package Geometry

  - New SegmentComputer (a.k.a. geometrical primitives to use for
    recognition, curve decomposition,...) : ArithDSS3D (3D DSS), DCA
    (Digital Circular Arcs), CombinatorialDSSS, ...

  - New normal vector field estimation based on elementary normal
    vector convolution in n-D

  - Distance Transformation by Fast Marching Method added.

* Package IO

  - Complete refactoring of the way a DGtal object is displayed in
    boards/viewers.

  - New 2D board  backend: you can export your drawning in TikZ for
    latex includes.
