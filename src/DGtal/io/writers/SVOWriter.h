   * @brief Helper class to write an octree to a file.
   *
   * The file format is structured in two sections in this order: 
   * the header and the data.
   *
   * Header:
   *  - The header uses ASCII.
   *  - The fields have a case sensitive name, the value is separated
   *  by a ':'. 
   *  - Each field is defined on its own line. A second ':' in a line would 
   *  be part of the value.
   *  - Spaces (' ', '\\r', '\\t') around the value are ignored. 
   *  - There is technically no specified order, although it is recommended 
   *  to follow the one below.
   *  - Fields are:
   *    - 'Format': Always 'SVO'.
   *    - 'Compression': Either '1' or '0', indicates if the data is compressed
   *    - 'Size': [uint], The number of voxels stored within the Octree.
   *    - 'State': [uint], Whether this is an SVO or SVDAG.
   *    - 'Dim': [uint], The dimension of the voxels.
   *    - 'LowerBound': int[Dim], Exactly 'Dim' integers separated by spaces 
   *    giving domain lower bound.
   *    - 'UpperBound': int[Dim], Exactly 'Dim' integers separated by spaces
   *    giving domain upper bound.
   *  The header ends with a single '.' on the last line.
   *
   * Data:
   *  - The data are always written in binary.
   *  - When compressed, the data are compressed by the zlib algorithm with
   *  the best compression level available (9).
   *  - The uncompressed data are ALWAYS defined in little-endian order. 
   *  - The data are laid out in the following order:
   *    - SizeSize: 8 bytes: Size of array length in bytes.
   *    - PtrSize:  8 bytes: Size of childen indices in bytes.
   *    - Depth: SizeSize bytes: Depth of the SVO.
   *    - ChildrenCounts: (SizeSize bytes)[Depth]: Number of children at each level.
   *    - Chidlren: (PtrSize bytes)[...] : Indices for each children in the order of
   *    Depth, Child index, Ptr Index.
   *
   *  @tparam Space The space on which the Octree is defined
   *  @see SVOReader
