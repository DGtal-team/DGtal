Part of the \ref packageTopology.
  
This part of the manual describes how to define digital surfaces,
closed or open. A lot of the ideas, concepts, algorithms,
documentation and code is a backport from
<a href="https://gforge.liris.cnrs.fr/projects/imagene">ImaGene</a>
\cite ImaGene. Digital surfaces can be defined in very different way
depending on input data, but they can be manipulated uniformly with
class \ref DigitalSurface, whichever is the dimension. Note that the
topology within digital surfaces is computed on-the-fly. Since 0.9.4,
one can precompute the topology of a 3D digital surface with class
\ref IndexedDigitalSurface. In some usages (typically local
traversals), this can speed-up algorithms up to three times faster.

@section dgtal_digsurf_sec1  Introduction to digital surfaces

@subsection dgtal_digsurf_sec1_1  Possible definitions for digital surfaces

Although continuous surfaces are well defined as n-manifolds, a
digital or discrete analog of surface is more tricky to
define. Several methods have been explored to define consistent
digital surfaces. We mention three approaches here.

- Surface as specific subsets of \f$ Z^n \f$, i.e. as sets of
pixels in 2D, voxels in 3D, etc, with specific properties. This
approach was proposed by Rosenfeld in the 70s. The set \f$ S
\subset Z^n \f$ is a digital surface iff \f$ Z^n \setminus S \f$
is composed of two \f$ \alpha \f$-connected components and if \a
S is thin (i.e. if any point of \a S is removed, the preceding
property does not hold). This approach is not too bad in 2D,
becomes more complex in 3D (see the work of Morgenthaler and
Rosenfeld or Malgouyres) and is unusable in practice. For
instance the border of any digital object is generally not a
surface.
- Surface as \f$ n-1 \f$-dimensional cubical complexes. For
example, if a digital object is a pure \f$ n \f$-dimensional
cubical complex, its boundary is naturally a \f$ n-1
\f$-dimensional cubical complex. This seems at first sight a
good approach, and it works well with well-composed pictures and
images (see the work of Latecki et al.). The obtain complex is
indeed a \f$ n-1 \f$-manifold when realized in the Euclidean
space. However, if the object contains any \e cross configuration
(like two voxels connected by their edge, and the other two
voxels adjacent to them are not in the object) then the
preceding property does not hold anymore. Cubical complexes are
thus interesting for representing objects, but not so
interesting when one is interested by the geometry of its
boundary.
- Surface as set of n-1-cells with some specific adjacencies. This
approach is more or less the approach of Herman, Udupa and
others, which was designed originally for tracking surfaces in a
digital space. In 2D, this correspond to an interpixel
approach. You choose first if you wish an interior adjacency
(4-connectedness) or an exterior adjacency (8-adjacency). Two
linels (or edges) are connected if they are point-connected and
in case of a cross configuration they border the same interior
(resp. exterior) pixel. The principle is the same in 3D, where a
2-cell (surfel) has edge-connected surfels with a preference in
case of cross configuration.


We focus here on the last method to define digital surfaces.

@subsection dgtal_digsurf_sec1_2  Digital surface as a set of n-1-cells

Formally, the elements of the digital space \f$ Z^n \f$ are called
\e spels, and often \e pixels in 2D and \e voxels in 3D. A \e
surfel is a couple (u,v) of face-adjacent voxels. A \e digital \e
surface is a set of surfels. It is obvious that a spel is a n-cell
in the cellular grid decomposition of the space, while a surfel is
clearly some oriented n-1-cell which is incident to the two n-cells
u and v (see \ref moduleCellularTopology).

Let \e s be some surfel. It is incident to two oriented voxels. By
convention, its \e interior pixel is the one that is \b positively
oriented.

We assume from now on that you have instantiated some cellular
space \a K of type \a KSpace (see dgtal_ctopo_sec4), for
instance with the following lines:

@code
KSpace K;
Point low( -10, -10, -10 );
Point high( 10, 10, 10 );
bool space_ok = K.init( low, high, true );
@endcode

A surfel is an oriented @f$n-1@f$-cell, i.e. some SCell. Surfel may be
obtained from spels by incidence relation. Reciprocally, you can
use incidence to get spels.

@code
typedef KSpace::SCell Surfel; // or typedef KSpace::Surfel Surfel;
typedef KSpace::SCell Spel; // or typedef KSpace::Surfel Surfel;
Spel v = K.sSpel( Point( 0, 0, 0 ), POS ); // +v
Surfel sx = K.sIncident( v, 0, true ); // surfel further along x
Surfel sy = K.sIncident( v, 1, true ); // surfel further along y
Surfel sz = K.sIncident( v, 2, true ); // surfel further along z
Spel qx = K.sDirectIncident( s, 0 ); // positive coboundary of s
Spel qy = K.sDirectIncident( s, 1 ); // positive coboundary of s
Spel qz = K.sDirectIncident( s, 2 ); // positive coboundary of s
ASSERT( v == qx && v == qy && v == qz ); // same as qx, qy, qz
@endcode

The direct orientation to some cell \e s is the one that gives a
positively oriented cell in the boundary or coboundary of \e s. 

You may now for instance define the digital surface that lies in
the boundary of some digital shape \f$ S \subset Z^n \f$ as the set
of oriented surfels between spels of \e S and spels not in \e
S. Algebraically, \e S is the formal of its positively oriented
spels, and its \e boundary is obtained by applying the boundary
operator on \e S.

@image latex digital-surface-BdryOp-5s.png "This is the resulting set of surfels (in blue and magenta." width=5cm

Defining a digital surface as a set of surfels is not enough for
geometry. Indeed we need to relate surfels together so as to have a
topology on the digital surface. The first step is to transform the
digital surface into a graph.

@subsection dgtal_digsurf_sec1_3  Digital surface as a graph: adding adjacencies between surfels

The idea here is to connect surfels that share some @f$n-2@f$-cells. The
obtained adjacency relations are called \e bel \e adjacencies in
the terminology of Herman, Udupa and others. Generally an @f$n-2@f$-cell
is shared by at most two @f$n-1@f$-cells, except in "cross
configuration", symbolized below:

@verbatim
   O | X    X: interior spels               O a X
   - + -    O: exterior spels               b + c
   X | O    - and |: surfels a,b,c,d        X d O
            +: n-2-cell 
@endverbatim

A bel adjacency makes a deterministic choice to connect b to d and a
to c when interior, and b to a and c to d when exterior. This
choice has to be made along each possible pair of directions when
going nD. In DGtal, this is encoded with the class SurfelAdjacency.

@image html digital-surface-IntAdjacency.png "Interior adjacency on digital surfaces in 2D" 
@image latex digital-surface-IntAdjacency.png "Interior adjacency on digital surfaces in 2D" width=5cm

The following snippet shows the interior surfel adjacency
(i.e. (6,18)-surfaces).

@snippet topology/volToOFF.cpp volToOff-SurfelAdjacency

Once the adjacency has been chosen, it is possible to determine
what are the adjacent surfels to a given surfel. More precisely,
any surfel (or @f$n-1@f$-cell) has exactly @f$2n-2@f$ adjacent surfels (for
closed surfaces). More precisely, it has exactly 2 adjacent surfels
along directions different from the orthogonal direction of the
surfel.

@image html digital-surface-SurfaceTracking2.png "Any surfel in 3D has 4 adjacent surfels." 
@image latex digital-surface-SurfaceTracking2.png "Any surfel in 3D has 4 adjacent surfels." width=5cm

In fact, we can be even more precise. We can use orientation to
orient the adjacencies consistently. Given two surfels sharing an
@f$n-2@f$-cell, this cell is positively oriented in the boundary of one
surfel and negatively oriented in the boundary of the other. We
have thus that there are @f$n-1@f$ adjacent cells in the direct
orientation (positive) and @f$n-1@f$ adjacent cells in the indirect
orientation (negative). The direct adjacent surfels look like:

@image html digital-surface-SurfaceTracking.png "Any surfel in 3D has 2 adjacent surfels in the direct orientation." 
@image latex digital-surface-SurfaceTracking.png "Any surfel in 3D has 2 adjacent surfels in the direct orientation." width=5cm

The class SurfelNeighborhood is the base class for computing
adjacent surfels. You may use it as follow, but generally this
class is hidden for you since you will have more high-level classes
to move on surfaces.

@code
// K is a KSpace, surfAdj is a SurfelAdjacency, surfel is some SCell.
SurfelNeighborhood<KSpace> sNeigh;
sNeigh.init( &K, &SAdj, surfel );
trace.info() << "surfel=" << surfel << endl;
trace.info() << "follower1(+)=" << sNeigh.follower1( 1, true ) << endl;
trace.info() << "follower2(+)=" << sNeigh.follower2( 1, true ) << endl;
trace.info() << "follower3(+)=" << sNeigh.follower3( 1, true ) << endl;
trace.info() << "follower1(-)=" << sNeigh.follower1( 1, false ) << endl;
trace.info() << "follower2(-)=" << sNeigh.follower2( 1, false ) << endl;
trace.info() << "follower3(-)=" << sNeigh.follower3( 1, false ) << endl;
trace.endBlock();
@endcode

Generally,  methods SurfelNeighborhood::getAdjacentOnSpelSet,
SurfelNeighborhood::getAdjacentOnDigitalSet,
SurfelNeighborhood::getAdjacentOnPointPredicate,
SurfelNeighborhood::getAdjacentOnSurfelPredicate are used to find
adjacent surfels.

Since we have defined adjacencies between surfels on a digital
surface, the digital surface forms a graph (at least in theory).


@section dgtal_digsurf_sec2  Tracking digital surfaces

This section shows how to extract the boundary of a digital set,
given some predicate telling whether we are inside or outside the
surface.

@subsection dgtal_digsurf_sec2_1 Constructing digital surfaces by scanning

Given a domain and a predicate telling whether we are inside or
outside the object of interest, it is easy to determine the set of
surfels by a simple scanning of the space. This is done for you by
static methods Surfaces::uMakeBoundary and Surfaces::sMakeBoundary.

The following snippet shows how to get a set of surfels that is the
boundary of some predicate on point by a simple scan of the
whole domain (see volScanBoundary.cpp).

@snippet topology/volScanBoundary.cpp volScanBoundary-ExtractingSurface

@subsection dgtal_digsurf_sec2_2  Constructing digital surfaces by tracking

In many circumstances, it is better to use the above mentioned graph
structure of digital surfaces. For instance it may be used to find
the surface just by searching it by adjacencies. This process is
called \b tracking. This is done for you by
static method Surfaces::trackBoundary.

The following snippet shows how to get a set of surfels that is the
boundary of some predicate on point given only a starting surfel
and by tracking (see volTrackBoundary.cpp).

@snippet topology/volTrackBoundary.cpp volTrackBoundary-ExtractingSurface

On the lobser.vol volume, volScanBoundary.cpp extracts 155068 surfels
in 3866ms, while volTrackBoundary.cpp extracts 148364 surfels in 351ms. 

@verbatim
# Commands
$ ./examples/topology/volScanBoundary ../examples/samples/lobster.vol 50 255
$ ./examples/topology/volTrackBoundary ../examples/samples/lobster.vol 50 255
@endverbatim

@image html volTrackBoundary-lobster.png "Digital surface that is the boundary of a (6,18)-connected component in image lobster.vol, extracted by tracking from an initial surfel in 351ms."
@image latex volTrackBoundary-lobster.png "Digital surface that is the boundary of a (6,18)-connected component in image lobster.vol, extracted by tracking from an initial surfel in 351ms." width=5cm

In the case you know \b beforehands that your surface is closed
(i.e. without boundary), you should use preferentially
Surfaces::trackClosedBoundary. This technique only follows direct
adjacent surfels and extracts the whole surface when it is
closed. This process can be illustrated as follows:

@image html suivi-artzy.png "Tracking a digital surface by following only direct adjacencies."
@image latex suivi-artzy.png "Tracking a digital surface by following only direct adjacencies." width=5cm

@subsection dgtal_digsurf_sec2_3 Other constructions by tracking: 2D contours, surface connected components, 2D slices in 3D surface

You can have a look at page \ref moduleDigitalSurfaceHelpers to see how
to construct directly a 2D contour in \f$ Z^2 \f$, how to get the
set of surface components, how to get 2D contours as slices onto a
3D surface.

You may also use the template class DigitalSurface2DSlice, which,
given a tracker on a digital surface, computes and store a 2d slice
on the associated surface. You may after visit the slice with
iterators or circulators. 
@code
// Tracker is a type of tracker on some digital surface.
typedef DigitalSurface2DSlice<Tracker> MySlice;
Tracker* ptrTracker = ... ; // some pointer on a tracker.
MySlice slicex( ptrTracker, 0 ); // slice containing x-axis
MySlice slicey( ptrTracker, 1 ); // slice containing y-axis
MySlice slicez( ptrTracker, 2 ); // slice containing z-axis
// One of them is invalid in 3D.
@endcode

@see digitalSurfaceSlice.cpp

@section dgtal_digsurf_sec3 High-level classes for digital surfaces

Digital surfaces arise in many different contexts:

- an explicit set of oriented surfels
- the boundary of an explicit set of spels
- the boundary of an explicit set of digital points
- the boundary of a set of digital points, defined implicitly by a
  predicate: Point -> bool
- a set of oriented surfels, defined implicitly by a
  predicate: Surfel -> bool
- a set of oriented surfels, implicitly by a
  predicate: Oriented Surfel -> bool
- the boundary of a region in a labelled image
- the frontier between two regions in a labelled image
- ...

Since there are so many digital surfaces, it is necessary to
provide a mechanism to handle them generically. The class
DigitalSurface will be the common proxy to hide models of
concepts::CDigitalSurfaceContainer.

@subsection dgtal_digsurf_sec3_1  A common architecture for digital surfaces

Since there may be several types of digital surfaces, there are
several container classes for them. All of them follow the concept
concepts::CDigitalSurfaceContainer. Essentially, a model of this class should
provide methods begin() and end() to visit all the surfels, and a
\e Tracker which allows to move by adjacencies on the surface. A
Tracker should be a model of concepts::CDigitalSurfaceTracker. The
architecture is sumed up below:

@image html diag-digital-surface-1.png "Class architecture of digital surfaces."
@image latex diag-digital-surface-1.png "Class architecture of digital surfaces." width=0.95\textwidth

@subsection dgtal_digsurf_sec3_2  Models of digital surface containers

For now, the implemented digital surface container are (realization
of concepts::CDigitalSurfaceContainer):

- model DigitalSetBoundary, parameterized by a cellular space and a
  digital set. Represents the boundary of a digital set (a set of
  digital points, considered as the set of pixels/voxels/spels of
  the space).
- model ImplicitDigitalSurface, parameterized by a cellular space
  and a predicate Point->bool. Represents the (connected) boundary
  of shape defined implicitly by a predicate. Computes at
  instanciation the set of surfels by a tracking algorithm.
- model LightImplicitDigitalSurface, parameterized by a cellular
  space and a predicate Point->bool. Represents the (connected)
  boundary of shape defined implicitly by a predicate. Do not
  compute at instanciation the set of surfels, but rather visits
  the surface on demand.
- model SetOfSurfels, parameterized by a cellular space and a set
  storing surfels. Represents an arbitrary set of surfels stored
  explicitly.
- model ExplicitDigitalSurface, parameterized by a cellular space
  and a predicate Surfel->bool. Represents a (connected) set of
  surfels defined implicitly by a predicate. Computes at
  instanciation the set of surfels by a tracking algorithm.
- model LightExplicitDigitalSurface, parameterized by a cellular space
  and a predicate Surfel->bool. Represents a (connected) set of
  surfels defined implicitly by a predicate.  Do not
  compute at instanciation the set of surfels, but rather visits
  the surface on demand.


Depending of what is your digital surface, you should choose your
container accordingly:
- an explicit set of oriented surfels: model SetOfSurfels, or if
  you wish to keep only one connected component, the model
  ExplicitDigitalSurface together with a model of concepts::CSurfelPredicate
  on your set.
- the boundary of an explicit set of spels: either convert it to a
  DigitalSet and use model DigitalSetBoundary, or use model
  ImplicitDigitalSurface and a concepts::CPointPredicate on your set of spels
  (require connectedness).
- the boundary of an explicit set of digital points: model
  DigitalSetBoundary directly
- the boundary of a set of digital points, defined implicitly by a
  predicate Point -> bool: model ImplicitDigitalSurface and a start surfel
- a set of oriented surfels, defined implicitly by a predicate
  Surfel -> bool: model ExplicitDigitalSurface and a start surfel.
- the boundary of a region in a labelled image: model
  ExplicitDigitalSurface and a start surfel, and the class
  functors::BoundaryPredicate, which is model of concepts::CSurfelPredicate.
- the frontier between two regions in a labelled image: model
  ExplicitDigitalSurface and a start surfel, and the class
  functors::FrontierPredicate, which is model of concepts::CSurfelPredicate.

Light versions of containers should be preferred in mostly two
cases:

1. The digital surface is big and you do not wish to keep it in
memory. This is probably the case when tracking some implicit
function and outputing it in some stream.
2. The digital surface is likely to evolve (i.e. the predicate do
not give the same response at a point/surfel depending on when
it is called).


@subsection dgtal_digsurf_sec3_3  Relating a digital surface to some container

The following snippet shows how to create a digital surface
associated to a LightImplicitDigitalSurface. The
LightImplicitDigitalSurface is connected to a shape described by a
predicate on point (a simple digital set). The full code is in
volBreadthFirstTraversal.cpp.

@snippet topology/volBreadthFirstTraversal.cpp volBreadthFirstTraversal-SetUpDigitalSurface

Once this is done, the object \c digSurf is a proxy to your
container. Here the dynamically allocated object is acquired by the
digital surface, which will take care of its deletion.

@note This creation of the container and the connection to a
digital surface takes almost no time, since the chosen container
(Light...) is lazy: the whole surface has not been extracted yet.


@subsection dgtal_digsurf_sec3_4  A digital surface is a graph, example of breadth-first traversal

Any DigitalSurface is a model of concepts::CUndirectedSimpleGraph (a
refinement of concepts::CUndirectedSimpleLocalGraph). Essentially, you have
methods DigitalSurface::begin() and DigitalSurface::end() to visit
all the vertices, and for each vertex, you obtain its neighbors
with DigitalSurface::writeNeighbors. You may thus for instance use
the class BreadthFirstVisitor to do a breadth-first traversal of
the digital surface.

We may extract the whole surface by doing a breadth-first traversal
on the graph. The snippet below shows how to do it on any kind of
digital surface, whatever the container.

@snippet topology/volBreadthFirstTraversal.cpp volBreadthFirstTraversal-ExtractingSurface

Here, we only use it to get the maximal distance to the starting
bel. A second pass could be done to display cells with a color that
depends on the distance to the starting surfel.

@snippet topology/volBreadthFirstTraversal.cpp volBreadthFirstTraversal-DisplayingSurface

We may call it as follows
@verbatim
# Commands
$ ./examples/topology/volBreadthFirstTraversal ../examples/samples/lobster.vol 50 255
$ ./examples/topology/volBreadthFirstTraversal ../examples/samples/Al.100.vol 0 1
$ ./examples/topology/volBreadthFirstTraversal ../examples/samples/cat10.vol 1 255
@endverbatim

to get these pictures:
@image html digital-surface-bfv-all.png "Examples of breadth-first traversal on a digital surface."
@image latex digital-surface-bfv-all.png "Examples of breadth-first traversal on a digital surface." width=0.5\textwidth

@note In fact, the specific container LightImplicitDigitalSurface
performs itself a breadth-first traversal to extract its vertices
by itself. Therefere, you may use a simple begin() and end() to get
the vertices in this order, when \b your \b container \b is \b a \b
LightImplicitDigitalSurface.

@todo The concepts concepts::CUndirectedSimpleLocalGraph and
concepts::CUndirectedSimpleGraph are susceptible to evolve to meet other
standards.

@subsection dgtal_digsurf_sec3_5  Boundary and frontiers  examples of digital surface

Surfels of a digital surface can also be defined by a predicate
telling whether or not some surfel belongs to it. Given an image of
labels, the class functors::BoundaryPredicate and functors::FrontierPredicate are such
predicates:

  1. functors::BoundaryPredicate ( KSpace, Image, l ) is a predicate returning
true for a surfel \a s iff the interior spel of \a s has label
\c l while the exterior spel of \a s has label different from \c l.

  2. functors::FrontierPredicate ( KSpace, Image, l1, l2 ) is a predicate returning
true for a surfel \a s iff the interior spel of \a s has label
\c l1 while the exterior spel of \a s has label \c l2.

Using container ExplicitDigitalSurface, we can very simply define
digital surfaces that are \b connected boundary of frontiers in
some image. The following snippet is an excerpt from
frontierAndBoundary.cpp.

@snippet topology/frontierAndBoundary.cpp frontierAndBoundary-SetUpDigitalSurface

Running it give the pictures:
@image html digital-surface-intersecting-balls.png "Frontiers and boundary of two intersecting balls. The first ball is labelled 1 (red), the second 2 (yellow), their intersection 3 (orange). The frontier between 1 and 0 is displayed in red, the frontier between 2 and 0 is displayed in yellow, the boundary of region 3 is displayed in orange."

@section dgtal_digsurf_sec4  The digital surface graph is a combinatorial manifold

@subsection dgtal_digsurf_sec4_1  Umbrellas and faces

We have shown before that a digital surface has a dual structure
that is the graph whose vertices are n-1-cells and whose arcs are
(almost) n-2-cells. We can go further and use n-3-cells to define
faces on this graph. This is related to the concept of \b umbrellas
in 3D (see \cite papier1998). More precisely, given a start surfel, an
incident n-2-cell (the separator) and an incident n-3-cell (the
pivot), one can turn around the pivot progressively to get a
face. This gives precisely in 3D the dual to a digital surface that
is a kind of marching-cube surface (see \cite Lachaud:1998-icip, \cite Lachaud:2000-gmod).

The main class for computing umbrellas is the class
UmbrellaComputer.  Turning around the pivot means moving the face
and the separator once (in the track direction), such that the
pivot is the same (ie \a +p), the track and separator directions
being updated. Repeating this process a sufficient number of times
brings the umbrella back in its original position, except in the
case when the DigitalSurface has a boundary touching the pivot. You
may use it to compute umbrellas given a tracker on your surface.

You may look at file testUmbrellaComputer.cpp to see how to use
this class directly.

@subsection dgtal_digsurf_sec4_2  Vertices, arcs and faces on a digital surface

However, it is simpler to use directly the methods defined in
DigitalSurface. It offers three types: DigitalSurface::Vertex,
DigitalSurface::Arc, DigitalSurface::Face to get the combinatorial
structure of the surface. An arc is an oriented edge, a face is a
sequence of edges that is closed when the pivot is not on the
boundary and open otherwise.

The following code lists the faces of a DigitalSurface object, and
for each face it lists the coordinates of its vertices.

@code
// MyDigitalSurface is a DigitalSurface realization.
// digSurf is any object of type MyDigitalSurface. 
// K is a cellular space. 
MyDigitalSurface::FaceSet all_faces = digSurf.allFaces();
for ( auto it = all_faces.begin(), it_end = all_faces.end(); it != it_end; ++it )
  {
    std::cerr << " face=" << K.sKCoords( digSurf.pivot( *it ) ) << ":";
    std::cerr << "(" << it->nbVertices << ")" << (it->isClosed() ? "C": "O");
    MyDigitalSurface::VertexRange vtx = digSurf.verticesAroundFace( *it );
    for ( unsigned int i = 0; i < vtx.size(); ++i )
      std::cerr << " " << K.sKCoords( vtx[ i ] );
    std::cerr << std::endl;
  }
@endcode 

DigitalSurface provides you with many methods to get faces from
edges or vertices and reciprocally.

- DigitalSurface::outArcs (Vertex): the range of outgoing arcs from
  the given vertex.
- DigitalSurface::inArcs (Vertex): the range of ingoing arcs from
  the given vertex.
- DigitalSurface::facesAroundVertex (Vertex): the range of faces
  containing this vertex [v]: 0 in 2D, 4 in 3D, 12 in 4D, 2(n-1)(n-2)
  in nD. Since DGtal 1.0, in 3D, the 4 faces may be ordered
  counterclockwise around the vertex (seen from the exterior), if the
  user specifies it. 
- DigitalSurface::head (Arc): the head vertex of the given arc
- DigitalSurface::tail (Arc): the tail vertex of the given arc
- DigitalSurface::opposite (Arc): the opposite arc of the given arc
  (may not exist if the arc lies on some boundary).
- DigitalSurface::arc (Vertex,Vertex): the arc from the first
  vertex toward the second.
- DigitalSurface::facesAroundArc (Arc): the range of faces incident
  to a given arc. Empty in 2D. 1 face in 3D, 2 in 4D and so one,
  n-2 in nD. Returned faces may be open.
- DigitalSurface::verticesAroundFace (Face): the sequence of
  vertices that touches this face. The order follows the order of
  incident arcs.
- DigitalSurface::allFaces (): the set of all faces of the digital
  surface (open and closed faces).
- DigitalSurface::allClosedFaces (): the set of all closed faces of
  the digital surface.
- DigitalSurface::allOpenFaces (): the set of all open faces of the
  digital surface.
- DigitalSurface::computeFace ( UmbrellaComputer::State ): compute
  the face from a given umbrella state.
- DigitalSurface::separator ( Arc ): the separator of a given arc
  (the n-2-cell between the two surfels forming the arc).
- DigitalSurface::pivot ( Face ): the positively oriented n-3-cell
  that is the pivot of the face.

@subsection dgtal_digsurf_sec4_3  Application to export surface in OFF format

In 3D, you may use faces to transform an arbitrary digital surface
into a polygonal manifold (closed or open). You can for instance
directly the method DigitalSurface::exportSurfaceAs3DOFF to do so,
or look at its code to see how it works.

The following snippets of file volToOFF.cpp show how to extract all
surfels in an image and then how to export the surface in OFF
format. The output is a surface that is very much the classical \b
marching-cube surface, except that vertices lies in the middle of
the edge.

@section dgtal_digsurf_sec5  Precomputed 3D digital surface with IndexedDigitalSurface

Digital surfaces are built upon digital surface containers. Although
containers may be very differnt, digital surfaces provide a uniform
interface to visit them and to explore their topology. But they are
merely just an interface. Hence neighbors, umbrellas, and sometimes
even vertices are recomputed on-the-fly as needed.

In some cases, it is a better idea to compute the topology once and
for all and to store it as fixed arrays. This is the purpose of class
\ref IndexedDigitalSurface.

@note For now, the class IndexedDigitalSurface can only handle 3D
digital surface containers. It is because the topology is stored in a
half-edge data structure (\ref HalfEdgeDataStructure), which can only
represents 2D combinatorial manifolds.


@subsection dgtal_digsurf_sec5_1  Creating an IndexedDigitalSurface

Similarly to a DigitalSurface, one creates an IndexedDigitalSurface
with a model of digital surface container
(concepts::CDigitalSurfaceContainer). The following snippet creates it
from a DigitalSetBoundary (the boundary of a ball of radius 3 here).

\code
#include "DGtal/helpers/StdDefs.h"
#include "DGtal/topology/DigitalSetBoundary.h"
#include "DGtal/topology/IndexedDigitalSurface.h"
#include "DGtal/shapes/Shapes.h"
...
using namespace DGtal;
using namespace Z3i;

typedef DigitalSetBoundary< KSpace, DigitalSet > DSContainer;
typedef IndexedDigitalSurface< DSContainer >     IDSurface;
// Creating the ball
Point p1( -5, -5, -5 );
Point p2(  5,  5,  5 );
KSpace K;
K.init( p1, p2, true );
DigitalSet aSet( Domain( p1, p2 ) );
Shapes<Domain>::addNorm2Ball( aSet, Point( 0, 0, 0 ), 3 );
// Creating the IndexedDigitalSurface by handling it a container
DSContainer dsc( K, aSet ) );
IDSurface   idx_dig_surf( dsc );
// The surface topology is now completely built.
std::cout << dsurf.nbVertices() << std::endl; // 174 
std::cout << dsurf.nbEdges()    << std::endl; // 348 
std::cout << dsurf.nbFaces()    << std::endl; // 176 
std::cout << dsurf.Euler()      << std::endl; //   2 
\endcode

@note We recall that, as for a DigitalSurface, an
IndexedDigitalSurface represents the topology of the dual of the
cubical cell complex formed by the surfels and their incident
cells. Hence vertices are surfels, edges correspond to linels (more
precisely a couple of surfels sharing an edge) and faces correspond to
pointels (more precisely an umbrella of surfels around this
pointels). It is because the topology of the primal digital surface
seen as a 2-dimensional cubical complex is not a 2-manifold in
general. However, for its dual, we are able to define a 2-manifold.

@subsection dgtal_digsurf_sec5_2  Guide for using an IndexedDigitalSurface

Once the indexed surface is created, you may use it as a
DigitalSurface. First it is a model of graph
(concepts::CUndirectedSimpleGraph). Hence traversal operations and
visitors apply. The main difference is that vertices, arcs and faces
are now numbered consecutively starting from 0. Therefore you have
methods to get a surfel from its vertex index, a linel from its arc
index, a pointel from its face index.

- IndexedDigitalSurface::surfel  : gets the surfel associated with a given vertex index.
- IndexedDigitalSurface::linel   : gets the linel associated with a given arc index.
- IndexedDigitalSurface::pointel : gets the pointel associated with a given face index.
- IndexedDigitalSurface::surfels : gets the whole mapping vertex index -> surfel.
- IndexedDigitalSurface::linels  : gets the whole mapping arc index -> surfel.
- IndexedDigitalSurface::pointels: gets the whole mapping face index -> surfel.
- IndexedDigitalSurface::getVertex: gets the vertex index of the given (oriented) surfel.
- IndexedDigitalSurface::getArc: gets the arc index of the given (oriented) linel (i.e. its separator).
- IndexedDigitalSurface::getFace: gets a face index of the given pointel (i.e. its pivot). Note that several faces may have the same pivot (up to four).

An indexed digital surface associates positions to its vertices (see IndexedDigitalSurface::position and IndexedDigitalSurface::positions). 

Then, most the services of DigitalSurface described in \ref
dgtal_digsurf_sec4 are available in IndexedDigitalSurface.

- IndexedDigitalSurface::outArcs (Vertex): the vector of outgoing arcs from
  the given vertex.
- IndexedDigitalSurface::inArcs (Vertex): the vector of ingoing arcs from
  the given vertex.
- IndexedDigitalSurface::facesAroundVertex (Vertex): the vector of faces
  containing this vertex [v]: 4 faces in 3D.
- IndexedDigitalSurface::head (Arc): the head vertex of the given arc
- IndexedDigitalSurface::tail (Arc): the tail vertex of the given arc
- IndexedDigitalSurface::opposite (Arc): the opposite arc of the given arc
  (may not exist if the arc lies on some boundary).
- IndexedDigitalSurface::arc (Vertex,Vertex): the arc from the first
  vertex toward the second.
- IndexedDigitalSurface::facesAroundArc (Arc): the vector of faces incident
  to a given arc. Only 1 face in 3D. Returned face may be open.
- IndexedDigitalSurface::verticesAroundFace (Face): the sequence of
  vertices that touches this face. The order follows the order of
  incident arcs.
- IndexedDigitalSurface::allFaces (): the vector of all faces of the
  digital surface, i.e. an array containing 0,
  1, 2, ..., nbFaces()-1.

The following services are also provided:

- IndexedDigitalSurface::allArcs (): the vector of all arcs of the
  digital surface, i.e. an array containing 0, 1, 2, ..., nbArcs()-1.
- IndexedDigitalSurface::allVertices (): the vector of all vertices of the
  digital surface, i.e. an array containing 0, 1, 2, ..., nbVertices()-1.
- IndexedDigitalSurface::allBoundaryArcs (): the vector of all arcs of the
  digital surface lying on its boundary.
- IndexedDigitalSurface::allBoundaryVertices (): the vector of all vertices of the
  digital surface lying on its boundary.
- IndexedDigitalSurface::next (Arc): the next arc along the (only) incident face.
- IndexedDigitalSurface::faceAroundArc (Arc): the (only) face incident
  to a given arc (in 3D). Returned face may be open.
- IndexedDigitalSurface::isVertexBoundary (Vertex): true iff it lies
  on the boundary.
- IndexedDigitalSurface::isArcBoundary (Arc): true iff it lies
  on the boundary.

@subsection dgtal_digsurf_sec5_3  When using an IndexedDigitalSurface instead of a DigitalSurface ?

You should use an IndexedDigitalSurface when:
- the digital surface is never modified
- you use a lot traversal operations (like computing k-neighborhoods everywhere)
- you use a lot surface operations (order of faces around a vertex)
- you do not use too much the cell geometry and topology but just their combinatorial relations
- or you need to number your cells consecutively.

You should use a DigitalSurface when
- you use a lot the geometry and topology of cells
- the digital surface is sometimes modified (then use light containers)
- you just iterate over surfels and perform few neighborhood operations.

Examples area-estimation-with-digital-surface.cpp and
area-estimation-with-indexed-digital-surface.cpp illustrate the
similarities of classes DigitalSurface and IndexedDigitalSurface as
well as their slight differences. They show how to estimate the area
of a digital sphere.
