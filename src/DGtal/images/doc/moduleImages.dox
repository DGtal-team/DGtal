\section dgtalImagesAbstract Overview

The concept of @a point functor describe a mapping between 
the points of a digital space and a set of values. 
The only method of a point functor is the `operator()`, 
which must take a point as input parameter and must return a value.

The concept of @a constant image is a point functor bounded by a domain. 
It is thus a refinement of the concept of point functor, 
describing a mapping between points and values, but having in addition a domain, 
returned by the `domain` method, and a range of values 
(for each point of the domain), returned by the `constRange` method.  

The concept of @a image, which is a refinement of the concept of constant image, 
provides extra services to update values.  
Any model of image must have a method `setValue` 
taking a point and a value as input parameters
and updating the value associated with the given point with the given value.  
In addition, they must have a range, returned by the `range` method,
providing output iterators.  

Different models of images are available: ImageContainerBySTLVector, 
ImageContainerBySTLMap, and --- coming soon --- experimental::ImageContainerByHashTree, 
 experimental::ImageContainerByITKImage, a wrapper for ITK images. 

 \section dgtalImagesDetails Let us go into details 

In this section, the concepts and the main services 
to read and write values in images are detailed.  

  \subsection dgtalImagesConcepts Concepts

Any model of the concept CPointFunctor must have two nested types:
 
  - Point, which specifies the type for a point.
  - Value, which specifies the type for a value.

Moreover, it must have the following method: 

  - `operator()`, which takes a point as input parameter
and returns a value, like a function.

The concept CConstImage is a refinement of CPointFunctor. 
Its models must have two extra nested types: 

  - Domain, a model of CDomain
  - ConstRange, a model of CConstBidirectionnalRangeFromPoint

Obviously, there are two methods 
that return instances of these two types: 

  - `domain`, which returns a constant reference on the image domain
  - `constRange`, which returns a range providing constant bidirectional 
iterators on the image values (associated to each point of the image domain)

You can see @ref moduleSpacePointVectorDomain for more
details about spaces and domains and @ref dgtalImagesRanges 
for more details about ranges in images.

The concept CImage is refinement of CConstImage.  
Images, instead of constant ones, provide services
to update values. 
The main way of assigning values to points is the 
following method: 

  - `setValue`, which updates a given value at a given point. 

Moreover, in addition to the ConstRange, images must have
the following inner type: 

  - Range, a model of CConstBidirectionalRangeFromPoint, like ConstRange,
and a model of CBidirectionalOutputRangeFromPoint, which must provide 
output iterators for incrementally updating a (sub)range of values.   

Obviously, you can get an instance of this type using the following method: 

  - `range`, which returns a range providing both constant bidirectional 
iterators and output iterators. 

Lastly, note that the Value type in the (constant) images
is expected to be at least a model of CLabel, ie.  
to be default-constructible, assignable and equality comparable.

@note In the snippets of the following subsections, 
the type of image used is `Image` and its instances are `image`, `image1`, `image2`. 

  \subsection dgtalImagesMainMethods Main methods


All models of images have a domain returned by the method `domain`. 
This domain is the set of points for which the image is defined
and has values. Since a domain is a range, you can straightforwardly 
use it in order to iterate over the points of an image. 

    //iterate over the points
    Image::Domain d = image.domain(); 
    for (Image::Domain::ConstIterator it = d.begin(), itEnd = d.end(); 
    it != itEnd; ++it)
    {}

Models of images have also two main methods in order to 
read or write values at a given point: 

- `operator()` to get the value associated to a given point 
- `setValue` to assign a value to a given point. 

    //process the values
    Image::Domain d = image.domain(); 
    for (Image::Domain::ConstIterator it = d.begin(), itEnd = d.end(); 
    it != itEnd; ++it)
    {
    Image::Value v = image( *it ); 
    v += 5; //adding 5 to all values
    image.setValue( v ); 
    }


Note that this method of iterating over the values of an image
is not always the fastest and that is why we also provide ranges. 


  \subsection dgtalImagesRanges Ranges of values

Constant images provide a constant range of values returned by the `constRange` method.
As every model of CConstBidirectionalRange, it provides `begin`, `end`, `rbegin` and `rend`
 methods returning constant iterators to iterate over the values in the forward or
backward direction. 

    //iterate over the values
    Image::ConstRange r = image.constRange(); 
    for (Image::ConstRange::ConstIterator it = r.begin(), itEnd = r.end(); 
    it != itEnd; ++it)
    {} 

However, this range is also a model of CConstBidirectionalRangeFromPoint, 
which is a refinement of CConstBidirectionalRange. That is why it also has 
overloaded versions of the `begin` and `rbegin` methods taking a point as input argument. 
This provides a way of iterating on sub-ranges defined from points.  

    //iterator on the origin (0, ... , 0)
    Image::ConstRange::ConstIterator it = r.begin( Image::Point::diagonal(0) )

Note that if the point does not belong to the domain, 
the returned iterators (resp. reverse iterators) 
must be equal to the `end` (resp. `rend`) methods. 

    ASSERT( image.constRange().begin( image.domain().end() ) == image.constRange().end() )


Images provide in addition to a constant range, a richer range returned by the `range` method.
This range is not only a model of CBidirectionalRangeFromPoint, but also a model 
of CBidirectionalOutputRangeFromPoint. That is why, it must have two methods:   
`outputIterator` and `routputIterator` returning output iterators. Moreover, 
it must have overloaded versions of these methods taking a point as input argument. 
Thus, these output iterators are useful in order to incrementaly fill (a part of) an image. 
For instance, you can fill an image from the values of another one 
(assumed to have the same domain) as follows: 

    Image::Range r1 = image1.range(); 
    Image::ConstRange r2 = image2.constRange(); 
    std::copy( r2.begin(), r2.end(), r1.outputIterator() ); 

 \section dgtalImagesModels Main models

Different models of images are available: ImageContainerBySTLVector, 
ImageContainerBySTLMap, and --- coming soon --- experimental::ImageContainerByHashTree, 
 experimental::ImageContainerByITKImage, a wrapper for ITK images. 

  \subsection dgtalImagesModelsVector ImageContainerBySTLVector

ImageContainerBySTLVector is a model of CImage 
that inherits the STL vector class. 
The hyper-rectangular domain, which the only model
of domain accepted, is linearized so that  
each point is mapped, from its coordinates, into an index 
and each index is mapped into a unique value, as in any 
one-dimensional array. 

Let \f$ n \f$ be the domain size (the number of points). 
At construction all the needed space is allocated 
and filled with a default value (0) in \f$ O(n) \f$ space and time. 
After that, you can access to the value associated
to any point at any time. Each access for reading (`operator()`)
or writing ('setValue`) values is in \f$ O(1) \f$.

The (constant) range of this class only used the built-in iterators
of the underlying STL vector. It is therefore a fast way of 
iterating over the values of the image. 

  \subsection dgtalImagesModelsMap ImageContainerBySTLMap

ImageContainerBySTLMap is a model of CImage
that inherits the STL map class. 
The domain can be any set of points. 
Values are stored and associated to points
in pairs point-value. 
The set of points stored in 
this way may be any domain subset. 
A default value (user-defined) is automatically 
associated to each point of the domain that
does not belong the subset for which values are known. 
Once constructed (in \f$ O(1) \f$), the image is valid and every point of the
image domain has a value, which can be read and overwritten.

The pairs point-value are stored in a red-black tree, 
where the points are used as keys, so that  
each access for reading (`operator()`)
or writing (`setValue`) values is in \f$ O(log m) \f$, 
where \f$ m \f$ is the cardinal of the subset for which values
are known (less or equal to the domain size \f$ n \f$).  

The (constant) range of this class adapts the domain iterators
in order to deal with values instead of points. The `operator*`
of the iterators provided by the range calls the `operator()` 
and use the `setValue` method of the class. 



\subsection dgtalImagesModelsHashTree ImageContainerByHashTree

experimental::ImageContainerByHashTree is an experimental image
container implementing a pointerless nD-tree structure. In dimension 2
and 3, this structure is similar to quadtree and octree repsectively
in which hierarchical links between a node and its children is given
by prefix of a binary representation of the node coordinates using
Morton keys. Finally, data values are stored in the structure in a
hash table whose hash function is a suffix on the Morton key code. 

Such container is well adapted for high resolution sparse images.

For more details, please refer to @cite Lewiner2009a

 \section dgtalImagesAdapters Image Adapter classes

ImageAdapter, ConstImageAdapter are perfect swiss-nifes to transform
and adapt images (change their domain definition, change their value
types, ...). These classses are parametrized by several types and
functor in order to adapt the behavior of image getters/setters (@a operator() and @a
setValue methods). These adapted behaviors are computed on-the-fly
when calling these methods.


* ConstImageAdapter requires several types and functors to create a
"read-only" adapted image (operator(), constRange(), ...)

* ImageAdapter requires a supplementary functor and allows write
 access to the image (@a setValue methods, range(), ... )

@note Functors used to convert domains or values may be complex. Keep
in mind that each time operator() or setValue() methods are called,
such functors are evaluated (with potential side-effects depending on
the functors).


\subsection constimage  ConstImageAdapter 

ConstImageAdapter is a small class that adapts any (constant or not)
image into a constant one, which provides a virtual view (so
read-only) of the true values contained in the adapted image.  The
class is parametrized by several template arguments:
* @a TImageContainer: the type of image to adapt.
* @a TNewDomain: the type of the new domain.
* @a TFunctorD: type of functor used to convert image domain points to
new domain points
* @a TNewValue: type of the new image value type.
* @a TFucntorV: functor to convert values.


The values associated to access the point values are adapted  
 with a functor @a g and a functor @a f given at construction so that 
 operator() calls @a f(img(g(aPoint))), instead of calling directly 
 img.operator() of the underlying image @a img.

Functor g (and/or functor f) can be a default functor, i.e. a
 simple functor that just returns its argument.

In order to illustrate the next ConstImageAdapter usage samples,
 we are going a) to use these includes:

@snippet ../examples/images/exampleConstImageAdapter.cpp include 

b) then define these types and variables:

@snippet ../examples/images/exampleConstImageAdapter.cpp def 

c) then define a simple 16x16 (1,1) to (16,16) image (of 'unsigned char' type):

@snippet ../examples/images/exampleConstImageAdapter.cpp image_creation 

filled with 0 to 255 values like that:

@snippet ../examples/images/exampleConstImageAdapter.cpp image_filling 

which looks like that with a simple HueShadeColorMap varying from 0 to 255 and with (1,1) the first bottom-left point:

\image html image.png " (1) simple 16x16 image: (1,1) to (16,16) drawn with a simple HueShadeColorMap varying from 0 to 255." 
\image latex image.png " (1) simple 16x16 image: (1,1) to (16,16) drawn with a simple HueShadeColorMap varying from 0 to 255." width=5cm 

Here is now the construction of a simple image adapter that 
 use a subdomain of the initial image domain to
 access the first bottom-left 8x8 image: 

@snippet ../examples/images/exampleConstImageAdapter.cpp ConstImageAdapterForSubImage_creation 

and here is the result:
\image html subImage.png " (2) first bottom-left 8x8 image: (1,1) to (8,8) adapted from image (1) with a subdomain." 
\image latex subImage.png " (2) first bottom-left 8x8 image: (1,1) to (8,8) adapted from image (1) with a subdomain." width=5cm 


Here is then the construction of an image adapter that 
 use a specific domain: here, only one pixel on two in x and y coordinates, created like that:

@snippet ../examples/images/exampleConstImageAdapter.cpp specificDomain_creation

from the initial image domain. 

@snippet ../examples/images/exampleConstImageAdapter.cpp ConstImageAdapterForSpecificImage_creation

Here is the result:

\image html specificImage.png " (3) 16x16 image: (1,1) to (16,16) adapted from image (1) with a specific domain." 
\image latex specificImage.png " (3) 16x16 image: (1,1) to (16,16) adapted from image (1) with a specific domain." width=5cm </TD>

Here is now the construction of an image adapter that 
 is a thresholded view of the initial scalar image: 

@snippet ../examples/images/exampleConstImageAdapter.cpp ConstImageAdapterForThresholderImage_creation

and here is the result with a simple GrayscaleColorMap varying from 0 to 1:

\image html thresholderImage.png " (4) 16x16 image: (1,1) to (16,16) adapted from image (1) with a thresholder set to 127." 
\image latex thresholderImage.png " (4) 16x16 image: (1,1) to (16,16) adapted from image (1) with a thresholder set to 127." width=5cm 

Here is finally the construction of an image adapter that 
 use a functor to change 'unsigned char' values to 'double'
 values using a log scale functor defined like that:

@snippet ../examples/images/exampleConstImageAdapter.cpp LogScaleFunctor

defined from the initial image: 

@snippet ../examples/images/exampleConstImageAdapter.cpp ConstImageAdapterForLogScale_creation

and here is the result with a simple HueShadeColorMap varying from 0. to logScale(255):

\image html logImage.png " (5) 16x16 image: (1,1) to (16,16) adapted from image (1) with a log scale functor." 
\image latex logImage.png " (5) 16x16 image: (1,1) to (16,16) adapted from image (1) with a log scale functor." width=5cm 


\subsection imageadat  ImageAdapter 

ImageAdapter is a small class that adapts an image (like
ConstImageAdapter) but provides a virtual access (reading and writing)
of the true values contained in the adapted image.  It uses a given
Domain (i.e. a subdomain) but work directly (for reading and writing
processes) thanks to an alias (i.e. a pointer) on the original Image
given in argument.

This class requires an additional templare paremter:
* @a TFunctoVm1: functor to convert adapted image values to the original
 image values. 

The values associated to accessing the point values are adapted  
 with a functor g and a functor f given at construction so that 
 operator() calls f(img(g(aPoint))), instead of calling directly 
 operator() of the underlying image img.

The values associated to writing the points are adapted  
 with a functor @a g and a functor @f$ f^{-1}@f$ given at construction so that 
 setValue() is @a img.setValue(g(aPoint), f-1(aValue)).

The use is the same that for ConstImageAdapter.

 \section dgtalImagesFunctions Useful classes and functions

In addition to the image containers and the image adapters described in the previous sections, 
there are also image proxys: 

Image is a light proxy on image containers based on a COW pointer.
It can be constructed, copied, assigned, deleted without any special care. 
 
Moreover, in ImageHelper.h, many useful functions are provided. 

1. Conversely, others convert images into digital sets with value comparators:
setFromPointsRangeAndPredicate, setFromPointsRangeAndFunctor, setFromImage.

2. Some of them convert digital sets into images,
imageFromRangeAndValue assigns a given value in an image to each point of a given range.

3. Some functions are available to fastly fill images 
from point functors or other images: imageFromFunctor and imageFromImage.

4. Lastly, some functor like the Projector from BasicPointFunctors can be useful to manipulate domain points and permits to extract N-1 images from ND images (see example \ref extract2DImagesFrom3D.cpp).
