\section dgtalBigImagesAbstract Overview

Large images like tiled images, HDF5 images, ... can be handled in DGtal.

For this, we provide two important mechanisms: an image factory mechanism and an image cache mechanism with read and write policies.

The image factory is necessary to keep control on the created images. As its responsability is to create images according to a domain,
it is obvious that the factory can update (flush) the image on disk and also can free the image from memory.
It is thanks to that that we can work with specific image formats like for example HDF5.
This mechanism is a DGtal concept called CImageFactory which is detailed just after.

As we want to take also into account the large images effectively we also need a cache mechanism to access subparts of tiled images.
The cache has the responsability to store tiles and giving us read and write access to them. The reading, writing and updating mechanisms of the cache
are controlled with two policies: the read and the write policies.
These policies are DGtal concepts called respectively CImageCacheReadPolicy and CImageCacheWritePolicy which are detailed just below.

The cache mechanism is rather simple. It consists of three important functions that are detailed here:

 - the `read` function returns true and get the value of an image from cache at a given position given by a point only if that point belongs to an image from cache, else returns false.

 - the `write` function returns true and set the value of an image from cache at a given position given by a point only if that point belongs to an image from cache, else returns false.

 - the `update` function update the cache according to the read policy.

\section dgtalBigImagesConcepts Concepts

\subsection dgtalBigImagesFactoryConcepts CImageFactory

Any model of the concept CImageFactory must have this nested type:
 
  - OutputImage, which specifies the type of the images created by the factory.

Moreover, it must have the following methods:

  - `requestImage`, which takes a domain as input parameter
and returns an OutputImage pointer on the created image.

  - `flushImage`, which takes an OutputImage pointer as input parameter
in order to flush/synchronize it on disk.

  - `detachImage`, which takes an OutputImage pointer as input parameter
in order to delete/release it.

\subsection dgtalBigImagesCachePoliciesConcepts Cache policies concepts

Cache policies concepts are divided in two concepts: read and write policies.

\subsubsection dgtalBigImagesCacheReadPolicyConcepts CImageCacheReadPolicy

Any model of the concept CImageCacheReadPolicy must have this nested type:
 
  - ImageContainer, which specifies the type of the images stored in the cache.

Moreover, it must have the following methods:

  - `getPage`, which takes a point as input parameter
and returns an ImageContainer pointer on the image that contains the point or NULL if no image in the cache contains that point.

  - `getPageToDetach`, which returns an ImageContainer pointer on the image that we have to detach or NULL if no image have to be detached.

  - `updateCache`, which takes a domain as input parameter
in order to update the cache according to the defined cache policy.

\subsubsection dgtalBigImagesCacheWritePolicyConcepts CImageCacheWritePolicy

Any model of the concept CImageCacheWritePolicy must have this nested type:
 
  - ImageContainer, which specifies the type of the images stored in the cache.

Moreover, it must have the following methods:

  - `writeInPage`, which takes an ImageContainer pointer, a point and a value for that point as input parameters
in order to set the value on the image at the position given by the point.

  - `flushPage`, which takes an ImageContainer pointer as input parameter
in order to flush the image on disk according to the defined cache policy.

\section dgtalBigImagesModels Models

\subsection dgtalBigImagesFactoryModels ImageFactoryFromImage

The ImageFactoryFromImage model is a rather simple one. It implements a factory to produce images from a "bigger/original" one according to a given domain.

\subsection dgtalBigImagesCachePoliciesModels Cache policies models

Cache policies models are like concepts also divided in two models: read and write policies.

\subsubsection dgtalBigImagesCacheReadPolicyLASTModel ImageCacheReadPolicyLAST

The ImageCacheReadPolicyLAST model is a rather simple one. It implements a 'LAST' read policy cache.

The cache keeps only one page in memory, the last one.
When the page needs to be replaced, the new page replaces the old one.

\subsubsection dgtalBigImagesCacheReadPolicyFIFOModel ImageCacheReadPolicyFIFO

The ImageCacheReadPolicyFIFO model is a rather simple one. It implements a 'FIFO' read policy cache.

The cache keeps track of all the pages in memory in a queue, with the most recent arrival at the back, and the earliest arrival in front. 
When a page needs to be replaced, the page at the front of the queue (the oldest page) is selected.

\subsubsection dgtalBigImagesCacheWritePolicyWTModel ImageCacheWritePolicyWT

The ImageCacheWritePolicyWT model is a rather simple one. It implements a 'WT (Write-through)' write policy cache.

Write is done synchronously both to the cache and to the disk.

\subsubsection dgtalBigImagesCacheWritePolicyWBModel ImageCacheWritePolicyWB

The ImageCacheWritePolicyWB model is a rather simple one. It implements a 'WB (Write-back or Write-behind)' write policy cache.

Initially, writing is done only to the cache. The write to the disk is postponed 
until the cache blocks containing the data are about to be modified/replaced by new content.

\section dgtalBigImagesSamples Sample classes

\subsection dgtalBigImagesTiledImageFromImageSample TiledImageFromImage

The TiledImageFromImage is a simple class that implements a tiled image from a "bigger/original" one.

The tiled image is created from an existing image and with three parameters.
The first parameter is an alias on the image factory (see ImageFactoryFromImage).
The second parameter is an alias on a read policy.
The third parameter is an alias on a write policy.
The fourth parameter is to set how many tiles we want for each dimension.

Concerning the cache mechanism explained at the top of this document, the accessor `operator()` (i.e. the getter) and the setter `setValue` are therefore really simple to write
for the TiledImageFromImage class:

- the getter just returns the value of an image (from cache) at a given position given by a point if the image is in the cache.
If not, the cache is first update with the image that contains that point.

- in the same manner, the setter just write the value of an image (in cache) at a given position given by a point if the image is in the cache.
If not, the cache is first update with the image that contains that point.

In order to illustrate the next TiledImageFromImage usage sample,
 we are going a) to use these includes:

@snippet ../examples/images/exampleTiledImageFromImage.cpp include

b) then define these type and variable:

@snippet ../examples/images/exampleTiledImageFromImage.cpp def 

c) then define a simple 16x16 (1,1) to (16,16) image (of 'int' type):

@snippet ../examples/images/exampleTiledImageFromImage.cpp image_creation 

filled with 1 to 256 values like that:

@snippet ../examples/images/exampleTiledImageFromImage.cpp image_filling 

which looks like that with a simple HueShadeColorMap varying from 1 to 256 and with (1,1) the first bottom-left point:

\image html tiledImageFromImage-image.png " (1) simple 16x16 source image: (1,1) to (16,16) drawn with a simple HueShadeColorMap varying from 1 to 256." 
\image latex tiledImageFromImage-image.png " (1) simple 16x16 source image: (1,1) to (16,16) drawn with a simple HueShadeColorMap varying from 1 to 256." width=5cm 

Here is now the construction of a simple 4x4 tiled image with therefore 16 subdomains of the initial image domain.
The tiled image is created from an existing image and with three parameters.
The first parameter is an alias on an image factory (see ImageFactoryFromImage).
The second parameter is an alias on a read policy.
The third parameter is an alias on a write policy.
The fourth parameter is to set how many tiles we want for each dimension: 

@snippet ../examples/images/exampleTiledImageFromImage.cpp TiledImageFromImage_creation 

In this sample, we are going to work only with the 8 bottom subdomains of the original image.

At the beginning the cache is empty.

First we want to read the point 4,2 (which is in domain 1),

@snippet ../examples/images/exampleTiledImageFromImage.cpp TiledImageFromImage_read42 

so after that the cache is (domain1,empty). Here is the domain1:

\image html TiledImageFromImage-01-read.png " (3) read: not in cache, so, update. Cache: (domain1,empty). Read: domain1." 
\image latex TiledImageFromImage-01-read.png " (3) read: not in cache, so, update. Cache: (domain1,empty). Read: domain1."  width=5cm </TD>

Then we want to read the point 10,6 (which is in domain 7),

@snippet ../examples/images/exampleTiledImageFromImage.cpp TiledImageFromImage_read106

so after that the cache is (domain1,domain7). Here is the domain7:

\image html TiledImageFromImage-03-read.png " (4) read: not in cache, so, update. Cache: (domain1,domain7). Read: domain7." 
\image latex TiledImageFromImage-03-read.png " (4) read: not in cache, so, update. Cache: (domain1,domain7). Read: domain7."  width=5cm </TD>

Then we want to set the value of the point 11,7 to 1 (which is in domain 7),

@snippet ../examples/images/exampleTiledImageFromImage.cpp TiledImageFromImage_write117

so after that the cache is always (domain1,domain7). Here is the new domain7 after writing:

\image html TiledImageFromImage-05-write.png " (5) write: in cache. Cache: (domain1,domain7). Write: domain7." 
\image latex TiledImageFromImage-05-write.png " (5) write: in cache. Cache: (domain1,domain7). Write: domain7."  width=5cm </TD>

Then we want to read the point 2,3 (which is in domain 1),

@snippet ../examples/images/exampleTiledImageFromImage.cpp TiledImageFromImage_read23

so after that the cache is always (domain1,domain7). Here is the domain1:

\image html TiledImageFromImage-07-read.png " (6) read: in cache. Cache: (domain1,domain7). Read: domain1." 
\image latex TiledImageFromImage-07-read.png " (6) read: in cache. Cache: (domain1,domain7). Read: domain1."  width=5cm </TD>

Then we want to read the point 16,1 (which is in domain 4),

@snippet ../examples/images/exampleTiledImageFromImage.cpp TiledImageFromImage_read161

so after that the cache is (domain7,domain4). Here is the domain4:

\image html TiledImageFromImage-09-read.png " (7) read: not in cache, so, update. Cache: (domain7,domain4). Read: domain4." 
\image latex TiledImageFromImage-09-read.png " (7) read: not in cache, so, update. Cache: (domain7,domain4). Read: domain4."  width=5cm </TD>

Then we want to set the value of the point 16,1 to 128 (which is in domain 4),

@snippet ../examples/images/exampleTiledImageFromImage.cpp TiledImageFromImage_write161

so after that the cache is always (domain7,domain4). Here is the new domain4 after writing:

\image html TiledImageFromImage-11-write.png " (8) write: in cache. Cache: (domain7,domain4). Write: domain4" 
\image latex TiledImageFromImage-11-write.png " (8) write: in cache. Cache: (domain7,domain4). Write: domain4"  width=5cm </TD>

And finally, here is the modified original image after the two writings.

\image html tiledImageFromImage-image2.png " (9) result image." 
\image latex tiledImageFromImage-image2.png " (9) result image."  width=5cm </TD>
