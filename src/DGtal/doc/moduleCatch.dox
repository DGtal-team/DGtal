[TOC]


\section sectCatch1 Introduction

[Catch](https://github.com/philsquared/Catch) Is a C++ framework to
help unit test design. More precisely, thanks to couple of C++ macros,
Catch enabled unit test are easy to write and easy to review.

In this documentation page, we just describe how to write such test
files in DGtal. For a complete documentation of Catch, please refer to
[Catch](https://github.com/philsquared/Catch).

\section sectCatch2 Catch in DGtal

We illustrate here basic Catch usages using some tests on the
PointVector class.

First of all, all test files must include the following header:

@snippet exampleCatch.cpp exampleCatch-include

Once this header included, there is no need to create a @e main()
function in your @e cpp file, everything is handled automatically.

Unit tests are decomposed into TEST_CASE and SECTION in a test
case. For example, the following code performs some tests on the
PointVector class (see exampleCatch.cpp for details).

@snippet exampleCatch.cpp exampleCatch-example1

When compiling this simple test, the executable handles several
commandline options. For example

@code
./exampleCatch
@endcode
runs all test cases and sections. 

@code
./exampleCatch -s
@endcode
runs all tests with detailed messages

@code
./exampleCatch -d yes
@endcode
runs all tests with timings for each section.

@code
./exampleCatch --help
@endcode
displays all command-line options.

Please have a look to [Catch](https://github.com/philsquared/Catch)
for further macros and comments. For instance, tags can be associated
with sections and test cases allowing to only run specific tests.



@section sectCatch3 Advanced usages

In Catch, experimental macros exist to describe templated tests. For
instance, the following code tests some STL containers.

@snippet exampleCatch.cpp exampleCatch-example2

In this example, 6 test sections are automatically generated. The
resulting output (with timings) is:

@code
./exampleCatch  "STL Container test"  -d yes
Size of the default constructed container completed in 3.3e-05s
std::list<int> completed in 0.000124s
STL Container test completed in 0.0002s
Size after one insert completed in 9e-06s
std::list<int> completed in 3.5e-05s
STL Container test completed in 7.7e-05s
Size of the default constructed container completed in 1.5e-05s
std::vector<int> completed in 8.4e-05s
STL Container test completed in 0.000133s
Size after one insert completed in 1.2e-05s
std::vector<int> completed in 5.2e-05s
STL Container test completed in 0.000112s
Size of the default constructed container completed in 1e-05s
std::set<int> completed in 7.2e-05s
STL Container test completed in 0.000134s
Size after one insert completed in 1.5e-05s
std::set<int> completed in 5.7e-05s
STL Container test completed in 0.000116s
=========================================================
@endcode

@note In the current Catch version, the number of templated types must
be specified explicitly in the macro name (up to 8 templated types per
test case).
