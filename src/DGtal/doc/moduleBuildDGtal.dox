This part of the manual describes how to build DGtal on Linux, Mac OS X and Windows.

[TOC]

\section intro Introduction and first build

The DGtal library uses <a href="http://www.cmake.org">cmake</a> to
manage the project build on various systems.

To build DGtal in is minimal configuration, you need at least these
dependencies:

- \e c++ compiler (g++, clang++, ...) with C++17 features
- \e [cmake](http://cmake.org) (>3.1, optionally cmake-gui),
- \e |boost](http://www.boost.org) boost >= 1.50.0  (no need to have the libraries installed)
- \e zlib (already available in most OS)

To build DGtal in is full configuration, you may need these dependencies too:

- \e gmp,
- \e [CGAL](http://cgal.org) (build with Eigen enabled),
- \e [libIGL](https://libigl.github.io),
- \e cairo,
- \e qglviewer,
- \e insighttoolkit (ITK),
- \e [HDF5](http://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/)

If you want to generate the documentation, you would need:
- \e doxygen >= 1.8.0,
- \e graphviz.


@note Since 1.4, some dependencies could be installed using
[conan.io](https://conan.io). Just install the conan 2 binary and
cmake will install all libraries (which may take some time for the first build). For instance:
```
conan profile detect --force ##Conan profile
cd build
conan install .. --build=missing -s:a compiler.cppstd=gnu20 
cmake .. -G "Visual Studio 15 2017" -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE="conan_toolchain.cmake" -DCMAKE_POLICY_DEFAULT_CMP0091=NEW 
```

\subsection linux Build on Linux-based distributions

To build DGtal from the source archive, we use the CMake tool to
generate a Makefile or a project file for various IDE (KDevelop,
Xcode, Codeblock...).  In most linux distributions, all mandatory and
optional dependencies are available as packages (debian, ubuntu,
...). Please refer to your package manager to find the appropriate
package name and versions.


An important feature of cmake is the "out-of-source" build
process. Let us suppose that DGtal sources are in the DGTALSOURCES
folder. Hence, in a terminal you can create a build folder:
@code
cd DGTALSOURCES
mkdir build
cd build
@endcode

Next, use the cmake command to generate your Unix Makefile project
(default generator on Unix/Linux) like below for the minimal DGtal configuration:
@code
cmake ..
@endcode

For the full DGtal configuration, you have to set these options with cmake:
@code
cmake .. -DDGTAL_WITH_GMP=true  -DDGTAL_WITH_ITK=true  -DDGTAL_WITH_CAIRO=true -DWITH_QGLVIEWER=true 
@endcode

If no error occurs, you can build the DGtal lib and install it:
@code
make
sudo make install
@endcode


\subsection macos Build on Mac OS X

Then, since recent Mac OS systems are unix-like operating systems, the
easiest way to compile DGtal with cmake/make is to follow Linux-based
instructions from source code archive.


\section cmakeDGtal Main DGtal cmake options

In DGtal CMakeLists.txt, several options can be specified to custom the
library build. First, cmake has predefined build options (\e CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE) such as:
  - \e CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE
     - \b Debug: debug mode (e.g. C++ debug flags, DEBUG variable, ...)
     - \b Release: release build (e.g. optimized C++ compiler options, NDEBUG variable, ...)
  - \e CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX: a string containing the DGtal install path
  (e.g. by default on some linux: "/usr/local/").

Beside these options, user can also specify these options:

- \e DGTAL_BUILD_EXAMPLES (ON/OFF): to build DGtal examples (default: OFF)
- \e DGTAL_BUILD_TESTS (ON/OFF): to build the test suite (default: OFF)

- \e VERBOSE (ON/OFF): to define the \e VERBOSE variable
 (default: OFF). If set to ON, verbose
 messages are traced out.

- \e DEBUG_VERBOSE (ON/OFF): to define the \e DEBUG_VERBOSE variable
 (default: OFF). If set to ON, verbose
debug messages are traced out.


- \e  BUILD_SHARED_LIBS (ON/OFF): to build the lib as a shared library (default: OFF) but \b must be \b OFF actually on \b Windows



\subsection win Build on Windows / Visual Studio

DGtal core library compiles on Windows using Visual Studio 2015 or
newer (note that building DGtal on cygwin or MinGW environments is
trivial using linux based build). Since DGtal requires C++11 features
since release 0.9.1, compiling the library with older Visual Studio
compilers is not supported.

To generate the Visual Studio project, use the cmake (or cmake-gui)
tools with recent Visual Studio target. During the project generation,
you would have to specify the path to @e boost headers (or paths
needed for any optional dependency such as GMP, CGAL, Cairo...).


@note Do not forget to set @e BUILD_SHARED_LIBS cmake to false (static
DGtal lib target, default).


@advanced When working on DGtal within github, we have set up a
Windows container for continuous integration.
