    abstract = "Digital objects and digital surfaces are isothetic
                  structures per se. Such surfaces are thus not
                  adapted to direct visualization with isothetic
                  quads, or to many geometry processing methods. We
                  propose a new regularization technique to construct
                  a piecewise smooth quad- rangulated surface from a
                  digital surface. More formally we propose a
                  variational formulation which efficiently
                  regularizes digital surface ver- tices while
                  complying with a prescribed, eventually anisotropic,
                  input normal vector field estimated on the digital
                  structure. Beside visualiza- tion purposes, such
                  regularized surface can then be used in any geometry
                  processing tasks which operates on triangular or
                  quadrangular meshes (e.g. compression, texturing,
                  anisotropic smoothing, feature extraction)."

                  complex multi-material objects. Multi-labeled voxel
                  models are also ubiqui- tous in material sciences,
                  medical imaging or numerical simulations. We present
                  here a variational method to regularize interfaces
                  in multi-labeled digital images. It builds piecewise
                  smooth quadran- gulated surfaces efficiently, with
                  theoretical guarantees of stability. Complex
                  topological events when several materials are
                  considered are handled naturally . We show its
                  usefulness for digital surface approximation, for
                  voxel art regularization by transferring colori-
                  metric information, and for upscaling voxel models
                  to speed up coarse-to-fine modeling."

    abstract = {{This book is an introduction to level set methods and dynamic implicit surfaces. These are powerful techniques for analyzing and computing moving fronts in a variety of different settings. While it gives many examples of the utility of the methods to a diverse set of applications, it also gives complete numerical analysis and recipes, which will enable users to quickly apply the techniques to real problems. The book begins with a description of implicit surfaces and their basic properties, then devises the level set geometry and calculus toolbox, including the construction of signed distance functions. Part II adds dynamics to this static calculus. Topics include the level set equation itself, Hamilton-Jacobi equations, motion of a surface normal to itself, re-initialization to a signed distance function, extrapolation in the normal direction, the particle level set method and the motion of co-dimension two (and higher) objects. Part III is concerned with topics taken from the fields of Image Processing and Computer Vision. These include the restoration of images degraded by noise and blur, image segmentation with active contours (snakes), and reconstruction of surfaces from unorganized data points. Part IV is dedicated to Computational Physics. It begins with one phase compressible fluid dynamics, then two-phase compressible flow involving possibly different equations of state, detonation and deflagration waves, and solid/fluid structure interaction. Next it discusses incompressible fluid dynamics, including a computer graphics simulation of smoke, free surface flows, including a computer graphics simulation of water, and fully two-phase incompressible flow. Additional related topics include incompressible flames with applications to computer graphics and coupling a compressible and incompressible fluid. Finally, heat flow and Stefan problems are discussed. A student or researcher working in mathematics, computer graphics, science, or engineering interested in any dynamic moving front, which might change its topology or develop singularities, will find this book interesting and useful.}},

abstract="In a recent work, full convexity has been proposed as an alternative definition of digital convexity. It solves many problems related to its usual definitions, for instance: fully convex sets are digitally convex in the usual sense, but are also connected and simply connected. However, full convexity is not a monotone property hence intersections of fully convex sets may be neither fully convex nor connected. This defect might forbid digital polyhedral models with fully convex faces and edges. This can be detrimental since classical standard and naive planes are fully convex. We propose in this paper an envelope operator which solves in arbitrary dimension the problem of extending a digital set into a fully convex set. This extension naturally leads to digital polyhedra whose cells are fully convex. We present first a generic envelope operator which add points in required directions in parallel and prove that it builds a fully convex set. Then a relative envelope operator is proposed, which can be used to force digital planarity of fully convex sets. We provide experiments showing that our method produces coherent polyhedral models for any polyhedron in arbitrary dimension.",
