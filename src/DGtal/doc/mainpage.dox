# Overview

DGtal is a generic open source library for Digital Geometry
programming whose primary objective is to gather and structure different
developments from the digital geometry and topology community. The
benefits are numerous: to make easier the appropriation of our tools
for a neophyte (new Ph.D. students, researchers from other topics,
...), to permit better comparisons of new methods with already
existing approaches, to construct a federative project. Furthermore, we
believe this is a necessary step for better recognition of the
efficiency of discrete geometry techniques by the important image
analysis community. As a consequence, DGtal is designed to
simplify the construction of useful demonstration tools. New
results are thus easily shared with a vast audience.

On a more technical level, DGtal is developed in C++. Similarly to
other classical libraries such as CGAL, it follows the paradigm of
genericity with efficiency. This approach is made possible with the
now well-known notion of concepts, implemented with templated
types. The kernel of DGtal offers digital spaces of arbitrary
dimension, with user-chosen integer types. Several digital topology
algorithms are already implemented (Rosenfeld topology, connected
components, simple points, homotopic thinning). The kernel manages
generic images (standard raster images but also tree images). Basic geometric
primitives (digital lines and segments) are also available, as well as
arbitrary dimensional volumetric distance transforms. A stream
mechanism has been developed to display digital objects and export
results in different vector formats.

DGtal is a collaborative effort of the French ---for now--- digital
geometry community. It is still a work in progress but shows already
many promises to be the common basis for future developments made by
the digital geometry community.

DGtal received the [Symposium on Geometry Processing Software Award in 2016](http://awards.geometryprocessing.org/).


DGtal is associated with the projects [DGtalTools](http://dgtal.org/dgtaltools/)
and [DGtalTools-contrib](http://dgtal.org/dgtaltools/). Please have a look
at the [DGtalTools online
documentation](https://dgtal-team.github.io/doctools-nightly) for additional 
information.

@note From release 1.2, DGtal has a (partial) python binding. For more information, cf \subpage packageIntroduction
