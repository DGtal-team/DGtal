     Provides a set of functions to facilitate the computation of
     convex hulls and polytopes, as well as shortcuts to build cell
     complex representing a Delaunay complex.

     @tparam dim the dimension of the space where points and further objects live.
     
     @tparam TInteger the integral type used to define the digital
     space, a model of concepts::CInteger. It sets the coordinate type
     of input lattice points as well as output integral convex hulls
     and lattice polytopes.

     @tparam TInternalInteger the integer type that is used for
     internal computations of above/below plane tests, a model of
     concepts::CInteger. Must be at least as precise as
     TCoordinateInteger.
