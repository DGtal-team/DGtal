@page moduleVolumetric nD Volumetric Analysis using Separable Processes

[TOC]

@author David Coeurjolly, Roland Denis

This part of the manual describes the DGtal volumetric module. We
focus here on separable process based volumetric analysis such as
distance transformation, reverse distance transformation and medial
axis extraction.


\section introVol Introduction

For decades, distance transformation (DT) and geometrical skeleton
extraction have been standard tools for shape analysis
@cite Rosenfeld1966
@cite Rosenfeld1968 . The DT of a shape consists in
labeling object grid points with the distance to the closest
background pixel. From the DT values, we thus have information on the
shape geometry.  Besides its applications in shape description, DT has
been used in many situations such as shape analysis, shape matching,
shape-based interpolation, motion planning, image registration, or
differential measurement estimation.


In the literature, many techniques have been proposed to compute the
DT, given a metric with a trade-off between algorithmic performances
and the @e accuracy of the metric compared to the Euclidean one.
Hence, many papers have considered distances based on chamfer masks
@cite Rosenfeld1966   @cite Rosenfeld1968  @cite Borgefors1986CVGIP , or sequences of chamfer
distances; the vector displacement based Euclidean distance
@cite Danielsson1980  @cite Ragnemalm1993 the Voronoi diagram based Euclidean distance
@cite Breu1995   @cite Maurer2003PAMI  or the square of the Euclidean distance
@cite Saito1994-DT   @cite Hirata1996  .  From a computational point of view, several of
these methods lead to time optimal algorithms to compute the
error-free Euclidean Distance Transformation (EDT) for @e n-
dimensional binary images: the extension of these algorithms is
straightforward since they use separable techniques to compute the DT;
@e n one-dimensional operations -one per direction of the coordinate
axis- are performed.

In @cite dcoeurjo_pami_RDMA, it has been demonstrated that a similar decomposition
can be used to compute both the reverse distance transformation and a
discrete medial axis of the binary shape.

The separable decomposition and the associated algorithmic
tools can be used on a wider class of metrics (see  @cite Hirata1996  or
@cite Maurer2003PAMI). For instance, all weighted \f$l_p\f$ metrics defined in
@f$\mathbb{R}^d@f$ by
 \f[  d_{L_p} (u,v) = \left ( \sum_{i=0}^d w_i|u_i-v_i |^p \right )^{\frac{1}{p}}\f]
can be considered.

In DGtal, we have chosen to implement such volumetric tools such that
the underlying metric could be specified independently. As an
example, we illustrate the distance maps from a single source point
for various metrics in 2D using the generic DistanceTransformation method:

@image html DTmetrics-small.png "Distance maps for metrics  L_1, L_2, L_4, L_80 and Chamfer masks M_{3−4} and M_{5−7−11}."
@image latex  DTmetrics-small.png  "Distance maps for metrics  L_1, L_2, L_4, L_80 and Chamfer masks M_{3−4} and M_{5−7−11}."

\section voronoiSect Digital Voronoi Diagram Computation

The generic distance transformation is based on a prior Voronoi map
construction. Indeed, if we compute the Voronoi diagram of background
points, the distance transformation at an object point is exactly its
distance to the site associated with the Voronoi cell it belongs to.

The core of the implementation is based on a separable approach: For
example, in dimension 2, partial digital Voronoi maps of dimension one are
first computed in each row independently. Then such partial Voronoi
maps are updated using independent processes along the columns,
leading to a valid Voronoi map of dimension 2. In an algorithmic point
of view, the 1D processes used for both columns and rows are 
the same. In higher dimensions, the other dimensions are processed
similarly.

@note We say digital Voronoi map instead of Voronoi diagram since the
output of the result is the intersection between the Voronoi diagram
of exterior points with @f$ \mathbb{Z}^d @f$. Furthermore, along
Voronoi faces (@e e.i. when two sites are equidistant), only one sites
is considered when intersection with  @f$ \mathbb{Z}^d @f$.


In DGtal, the class VoronoiMap implements such digital Vornoi map
extraction. Such class is parametrized by the following types:
- a type representing the underlying digital space (model of CSpace);
- a type representing the object @f$ X @f$ as a point predicate (model
 of concepts::CPointPredicate)  ;
- a type representing the underlying metric (model of
CSeparableMetric, see below)
- and an optional image container to store the resulting Voronoi map
(by default, the type is
ImageContainerBySTLVector<HyperRectDomain<TSpace>,typename
TSpace::Vector>).

The VoronoiMap  constructor is parametrized by
- an instance of Domain (the Domain type associated with the image
container);
- an instance of the PointPredicate ;
- and an instance of the separable metric.

The VoronoiMap will be computed on the specified and will use the
point predicate to decide if a point of such domain is in the object
or note.

@warning The point predicate must be valid for each point in the
specified domain. Basically, the domain can a sub-domain of the point
predicate definition domain.


Once the VoronoiMap object is created, the voronoi map is computed and
the class itself is a model of CConstImage. In other words, you can
access to the VoronoiMap value at a point @a p and iterate of values
using image ranges (see @ref moduleImages). For example

@code
  VoronoiMap<....> myVoronoiMap( .... ); //object construction
  VoronoiMap<....>::Point p(12,34);

  VoronoiMap<....>::Value vectorToClosestSiteAtP = myVoronoiMap( p );
  for(VoronoiMap<....>::Domain::ConstIterator it  = myVoronoiMap.domain().begin() , itend = myVoronoiMap.domain().end();
  it != itend ; ++it)
       //do something on myVoronoiMap(it)
@endcode

Since we are constructing a VoronoiMap, the value type of the map is a
vector (pointing to the closest site) of type Space::Vector (if Space
was the underlying digital space type used when specifying VoronoiMap
template parameters).

Let us illustrate the construction in dimension 2 (see
voronoimap2D.cpp). Other examples can be found in distancetransform2D.cpp and distancetransform3D.cpp.

 First of all, we need couple of includes:

@snippet geometry/volumes/distance/voronoimap2D.cpp Voro2D-header

We will discuss later about the metric definition but let us consider
a classical Euclidean @f$ l_2 @f$ metric:

@snippet geometry/volumes/distance/voronoimap2D.cpp Voro2D-Metric

We now consider an object in a [0,0]x[16,16] domain with three
background points. To construct such point predicate, we first define
a set containing the three points, then we consider the point
predicate defined on this set (which returns true at a point if the
point is inside the set) and we consider the negation of such predicate
in order to return true for object points. Here you have the
construction:

@snippet geometry/volumes/distance/voronoimap2D.cpp Voro2D-SmallImage

and the resulting set:

@image html voronoimap-inputset.png "Input set."
@image latex voronoimap-inputset.png "Input set."


The voronoi map is simply given by:

@snippet geometry/volumes/distance/voronoimap2D.cpp Voro2D-Voro

At each point of the object, we thus have a vector to the closest
background point. We can display this information as follows:

@snippet geometry/volumes/distance/voronoimap2D.cpp Voro2D-trace

To obtain:

@image html voronoimap-voro.png "Voronoi map."
@image latex voronoimap-voro.png "Voronoi map."

Changing the board output, we can see the Voronoi cells accordingly:

@snippet geometry/volumes/distance/voronoimap2D.cpp Voro2D-traceCell

To get:

@image html voronoimap-cells.png "Voronoi map cells."
@image latex voronoimap-cells.png "Voronoi map cells."

We could easily change the metric (here to the @f$ l_8 @f$) and get a
new Voronoi map:
@snippet geometry/volumes/distance/voronoimap2D.cpp Voro2D-l8Metric

@image html voronoimap-vorol8.png "Voronoi map for the l_8 metric."
@image latex voronoimap-vorol8.png "Voronoi map for the l_8 metric."

@section DTsec Distance Transformation

As discussed earlier, the distance transformation is given by
computing distances once the Voronoi map is obtained. In DGtal, the
class DistanceTransformation simply adapts the VoronoiMap class in
order to override output image getters to return the distance for the
given metric to the closest site instead of the vector.

As a consequence, the DistanceTransformation class simply  inherits from  the
VoronoiMap class and overrides  methods required by
the concepts::CConstImage concept. Note that the DistanceTransformation::Value
type is double. If you want to get the underlying vector instead of
the distance to perform exact computations, you can use the
DistanceTransformation::getVoronoiVector method.

In the following example, we consider the previous small image and use
a colormap to display distance values for the @f$ l_2 @f$ mertic:

@snippet geometry/volumes/distance/voronoimap2D.cpp Voro2D-DT

@image html voronoimap-dt.png "Distance transformation for  the l_2 metric."
@image latex voronoimap-dt.png  "Distance transformation for  the l_2 metric."



@section RDTSec Digital Power Map and Reverse Distance Transformation

Similarly to Voronoi diagram and digital Voronoi maps, digital Power
maps are defined as the intersection between the integer grid and a
power diagram. Given a set of weighed points, power diagram can be
seen as Voronoi diagram where the metric is modified with additive
weights. For example, considering the @f$ l_2@f$ metric, the power
distance between a point @f$p@f$ and a weighted point @f$(q,w)@f$ is
defined by
@f[ pow(p,q) = \| p - q\|_2^2  - w @f]

Hence, similarly to Voronoi diagram, the power diagram is a
decomposition of the space ino cells from weighed sites where each
cell (maybe empty) is associated with a site and each point in the
cell has got minimal power distance to the cell site (compared to its
power distance to all other sites) @cite Aurenhammer1987 .


Separable algorithms similar to VoronoiMap/DistanceTransformation can
be designed to compute respectively PowerMap and
ReverseDistanceTransformation. The only difference is that the input of
PowerMap is a weighted set of points instead of a point predicate.

@note for @f$l_p@f$ metrics, the power distance is defined by @f$
pow(p,q) = \| p - q\|_p^p - w @f$. Hence, both the distance and the weight value type
capacity must be able to represent d-sums of power p numbers (if d is
the dimension of the space).


Hence such class is parametrized by the following types:
- a type representing the mapping between points and weights (WeightImage, model of concepts::CImage);
- a type representing the underlying power metric (model of concepts::CPowerSeparableMetric, see below)
- and an optional image container to store the resulting Power map (by default, the type is ImageContainerBySTLVector).

The PowerMap  constructor is parametrized by
- an instance of Domain (the Domain type associated with the image container);
- an instance of PowerMap::WeightImage;
- and an instance of the power separable metric.

Similarly to DistanceTransformation, ReverseDistanceTransformation
remaps the PowerMap vectors to map the power metric to the closest
weighted site.

As a consequence, for the Euclidean @f$ l_2 @f$ metric, if we consider
a set of balls @f$ B_i(p_i,r_i) @f$ and if we create an WeightImage
whose domain contains points @f$\{ p_i \}@f$ and with
values @f$ r_i^2@f$, negative (strictly) values of the
ReverseDistanceTransformation will correspond to digital points
belonging to the union @f$ \bigcup \{B_i\}@f$ (see @cite dcoeurjo_pami_RDMA).

ReverseDistanceTransformation can thus be used to reconstructed a
binary shape from a given Medial Axis or any set of balls. Another
consequence is that given a binary shape, the pipeline
@f[  Shape \rightarrow DT \rightarrow ReverseDT \rightarrow \text{ strictly negative values }@f]
for the same metric/power metric, returns the input binary shape.



@note Power separable metrics are formalized in concepts::CPowerMetric and
concepts::CPowerSeparableMetric concepts whose main model is
ExactPredicateLpPowerSeparableMetric, see @ref moduleMetrics

@section toricVol Volumetric Analysis on Toric domains

In some specific applications, toric domains and volumetric analysis
of shapes in toric domains are crucial. Thanks to the separability
property of VoronoiMap, PowerMap (and their associated wrappers
DistanceTransformation and ReverseDistanceTransformation), one can
easily consider volumetric transformation in arbitrary dimension on
toric domains @cite Coeurjo2008. Note that changing the periodicity
property of the domain has no impact on the computational cost.

More precisely, VoronoiMap and DistanceTransformation classes have
constructors allowing to specify periodicity information. In dimension
@e d, such periodicity information is an array with @e d boolean flags
where the i-th value is \c true if the i-th dimension of the space is
periodic, \c false otherwise. Hence, computation can be performed
either on a full toric domain, or on a domain with toricity property
along only one axis. Similar extensions to toric domains have been
implemented for the PowerMap and ReverseDistanceTransformation
classes.

As illustrated in the example toricdomainvolumetric.cpp, given an
input:

@image html toric-inputShape-red.png "Input domain and sites."

We consider the following distance transformation objects:

@snippet geometry/volumes/distance/toricdomainvolumetric.cpp DTComputeToric

The following results illustrate both distance transformation and
Voronoi maps. For the VoronoiMap results, points may be attached to
sites exterior to the initial domain. In fact such sites correspond to
toric replicas of existing sites within the domain. 

<center>
<table>

</tr>
</table>
</center>

Using VoronoiMap::projectPoint(Point) const, site's coordinates can be projected
into the initial domain, even for VoronoiMap calculated on toric domains:

@image html toric-example-Voro-L2-toric-projected.png "Voronoi map on toric domain with projected sites."

With partial periodicity specification (along the first or second dimension only):

@snippet geometry/volumes/distance/toricdomainvolumetric.cpp DTComputePartialToric

we obtain the following VoronoiMap:
