     Description of template class 'Surfaces' <p> \brief Aim: A
     utility class for constructing surfaces (i.e. set of
     (n-1)-cells).
     
     @tparam TKSpace the type of cellular grid space (e.g. a
     KhalimskySpaceND).

     Note that many methods requires a surfel adjacency so as to know
     how connected surfels are linked (first by the interior or first
     by the exterior). Secondly, many methods are parameterized by a
     PointPredicate which describes the shape as a characteristic
     function. This is to be more generic than a simple
     DigitalSet. With this approach, shapes can be defined implicitly.

     Essentially a backport from <a
     href="http://gforge.liris.cnrs.fr/projects/imagene">ImaGene</a>.
