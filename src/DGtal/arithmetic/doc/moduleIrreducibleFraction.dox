This part of the manual describes how to create and use irreducible
fractions. More precisely, several representations of irreducible
fractions are provided. They are based on the Stern-Brocot tree
structure. With these fractions, amortized constant time operations
are provided for computing reduced fractions.

\section dgtal_irrfrac_sec1 Introduction to positive irreducible fraction.

A positive \b irreducible \b fraction is a fraction \e p / \e q, such
that \e p and \e q are positive integers and gcd(\e p, \e q)=1. The
fractions \f$\frac{0}{1}\f$ (zero) and \f$\frac{1}{0}\f$ (infinite)
are added for convenience. Standard operations like '+', '-', '*', or
'/' can be defined over these fractions: it is a matter of playing
with numerators and denominators.

However, these fractions have other properties that are useful in the
context of digital geometry, especially in digital straightness. These
other properties are related to Euclid algorithm, the Stern-Brocot
tree, and simple continued fractions.

\subsection dgtal_irrfrac_sec1_1 Euclid algorithm

The well-known Euclid algorithm is useful to compute the greatest
common divisor of two integers \e p and \e q. However, its
intermediate computations are also useful. Let us play with 8/3 (see
IntegerComputer::gcd).

| p |=| u |*| q |+| r |
|---|-|---|-|---|-|---|
| 8 |=| 2 |*| 3 |+| 2 |
| 3 |=| 1 |*| 2 |+| 1 |
| 2 |=| 2 |*| 1 |+| 0 |
| 1 | |   |*| 0 | |   |

At each iteration, \e p takes the former value of \e q, \e q takes the
former value of \e r. The algorithm stops when \e q is null. Then \e p
is the gcd (1 here).

The values of \e u are called the \b quotients of \f$\frac{p}{q}\f$,
and are numbered from 0. A unique way to describe \f$\frac{p}{q}\f$
is the sequence \f$u_0,u_1,\ldots,u_k\f$, which is in fact denoted as
\f$[u_0;u_1,\ldots,u_k]\f$. This sequence \b characterizes the
fraction.

\subsection dgtal_irrfrac_sec1_2 Continued fraction

In fact, one can prove that
\f$\frac{p}{q}=u_0+\frac{1}{u_1+\frac{1}{\ldots+\frac{1}{u_k}}}\f$,
which is the simple continued fraction of \e p / \e q.

The successive fractions \f$\frac{p_i}{q_i}=[u_0;u_1,\ldots,u_i]\f$,
for \f$k < i\f$ are called the \e principal \e convergents of
\f$\frac{p}{q}\f$, and are the best approximations of this fraction for
the size of their denominator.

A \e i-\e reduced of a continued fraction is its \e k - \e i-th
convergent. The \e depth of the fraction is \e k.

A nice property of convergents with respect to their fraction is that even convergents
are smaller than the fraction while odd convergents are greater.

\subsection dgtal_irrfrac_sec1_3 Stern-Brocot tree

Another (but one-to-one) way of seeing irreducible fractions is the
Stern-Brocot tree. Place the fractions 0/1 and 1/0 at the top, then
for each pair of consecutive fractions \f$\frac{p}{q}\f$ and
\f$\frac{p'}{q'}\f$ compute its mediant \f$\frac{p+p'}{q+q'}\f$. The
fraction 1/1 appears first, then 1/2 and 2/1, then 1/3, 2/3, 3/2, 3/1,
etc.

@image html Sternbrocot.png "Stern-Brocot tree of irreducible fractions."

Now the sequence of quotients \f$u_0, u_1,\ldots, u_k \f$ is exactly
the sequence of right-then-left moves in the Stern-Brocot tree from
node 1/1 when \f$ u_0 \ge 1 \f$, except for the last \f$ u_k \f$ where
there is one less movement. Otherwise, when \f$ u_0 = 0 \f$, the
sequence \f$ u_1,\ldots, u_k \f$ is exactly the sequence of
left-then-right moves in the Stern-Brocot tree from node 1/1, except
for the last \f$ u_k \f$ where there is one less movement.

Looking back at \f$ 8/3=[2;1,2] \f$ gives 2 right moves, 1 left move,
then 2-1 right move.


\section dgtal_irrfrac_sec2 Implementation of irreducible fractions.

When playing with irreducible fractions, computing reduced fractions
or partial quotients is one of the main task. For instance, splitting
formula and Berstel splitting formula is intensively used by
algorithms related to digital straightness. Therefore, we must have
representations of irreducible fractions which are efficient for that
kind of requests.

Several representations have been implemented in the Arithmetic package. 
Their interface are common (see \ref dgtal_irrfrac_sec2_1) so that a user can 
choose which representation suits him best.

\subsection dgtal_irrfrac_sec2_1 Irreducible fraction concept

Irreducible fractions are first described abstractly with the concept CPositiveIrreducibleFraction.
Note that the following operations are defined for each irreducible fraction.

Inner types are:

- \e Integer: the type for representing a numerator or a denominator.

- \e Size: the type for representing partial quotients, i.e. the integers
  that appear in the continued fractions of p/q. Might be the same as
  Integer but may be also smaller, since quotients are generally much
  smaller than the convergent numerators and denominators.

- \e Value and \e value_type: the type \c std::pair<Size,Size>, useful
  to create back insertion sequence.

- \e ConstIterator and \e const_iterator: the type for visiting the quotients of the
  fraction in sequence. The value of the iterator has type \e Value.

Notations are:

- \e X : A type that is a model of CPositiveIrreducibleFraction
- \e x : object of type \e X, which is below some fraction written \f$[u_0, \ldots, u_k]\f$ as a continued fraction
- \e x1, \e x2, \e y : other objects of type \e X
- \e p, \e q : object of type \e Integer
- \e m, \e n1, \e n2 : objects of type \e Size
- \e quots : an object of type \c std::vector<Size>
- \e pair : a object of \c std::pair<Size,Size>, here (m,k+1)  


\subsection dgtal_irrfrac_sec2_2 Naive approach

A naive approach is to represent an irreducible fraction with three arrays of integers: 
the numerators (p_i), the denominators (q_i), the quotients (u_i).

However, each time we duplicate the fraction, or each time we compute a reduced fraction,
the complexity of the operation is proportional to the depth of the fraction, i.e. in O(k).

We wish to have amortized O(1) complexity for these operations. Therefore, we take another path.

\subsection dgtal_irrfrac_sec2_3 First approach with Stern-Brocot tree

This approach is implemented in the class SternBrocot::Fraction (see also class SternBrocot).
We construct on demand parts of the Stern-Brocot tree structure. 
For instance, if one wish to manipule fraction 8/3, the following
nodes of the tree are computed once and for all: 0/1, 1/0, 1/1, 2/1, 
1/2, 3/1, 1/3, 5/2, 2/5, 8/3, 3/8.

Each node in the Stern-Brocot is created once. The node stores
information on the irreducible fraction itself (p/q, the
partial quotient u, the depth k), but also pointers to
ascendants, descendants and inverse in the Stern-Brocot tree.
Nodes are constructed on demand, when the user ask for
descendant or for a specific fraction.

A fraction SternBrocot::Fraction is just a pointer to the corresponding 
node in the Stern-Brocot tree. Looking for a reduced partial is just moving 
from node to node.

@code
#include "DGtal/arithmetic/SternBrocot.h"
...
typedef SternBrocot<DGtal::int64_t,DGtal::int32_t> SB;
typedef SB::Fraction Fraction;
typedef Fraction::ConstIterator ConstIterator;

Fraction f1( 117, 45 ); // 117/45
Fraction f2; // null 0/0
f2.push_back( std::make_pair( 2, 0 ) ); // u_0 = 2
f2.push_back( std::make_pair( 1, 1 ) ); // u_1 = 1
f2.push_back( std::make_pair( 2, 2 ) ); // u_2 = 2
// f2 = 8/3
// Displays quotients of f1.
for ( ConstIterator it = f1.begin(), itend = f1.end();
      it != itend; ++it )
  std::cout << "u_" << (*it).second 
            << " = " << (*it).first << std::endl;
@endcode

You may have a look at testSternBrocot.cpp to see how to use these fractions.

Also inverses and reduced fractions are quickly computed, 
this representation has two disadvantages:
- it is memory costly: many nodes are created for a fraction. In fact \f$2\sum_{i=1..k} u_i\f$ nodes may be created.
- it is not optimal in terms of complexity. Reduced takes O(1) but computing \f$[u_0,...,u_{k-1},m]\f$ takes O(u_k-m).

\subsection dgtal_irrfrac_sec2_4 Second approach with Stern-Brocot tree

This approach is implemented in the class LighterSternBrocot::Fraction
(see also class LighterSternBrocot).

There are two main differences with the class SternBrocot. The
first one is that inverses are not stored. With this optimization,
there are twice less nodes and each node is lighter. The second one
lies in the access to the children of a node. Here, a map type M is
   provided so that a node \f$ [u_0; u_1, ..., u_n] \f$ can access its child
   node \f$ [u_0; u_1, ..., u_n, k] \f$ in the time of the operation
   M::operator[]. This representation is also different from
   LightSternBrocot in the sense that nodes have only one set of child
   nodes and that only fractions greater than 1/1 are stored.

   In this representation, the fraction 1/1 has depth 0, like 2/1,
   3/1, etc. Furthermore, each fraction \f$ [u_0,...,u_n] \f$ has an origin
   which is the fraction \f$ [u_0,...,u_{n-1},1] \f$. It is the top extremity
   of this branch. The origin has depth n-1 since \f$ [u_0,...,u_{n-1},1] \f$
   = \f$ [u_0,...,u_{n-1}+1] \f$. Inversely a k-child of \f$ [u_0,...,u_n] \f$, for k
   >= 2, is the fraction \f$ [u_0,...,u_n - 1, k] \f$. A 1-child of a fraction
   f is itself, except for the fraction 1/0 where its 1-child is 1/1
   by convention.

   In practice, also this class has supposedly a better complexity
   than SternBrocot, it is 1% slower for integers smaller than 10^9
   and 5% slower for integers smaller than 10^4. Note however that it
   takes like 7 times less memory (and asymptotically less when the
   number of computations tends toward infinity).

   This class is not to be instantiated, since it is useless to
   duplicate it. Use static method LighterSternBrocot::fraction or constructor of LighterSternBrocot::Fraction to obtain
   your fractions.

@code
#include "DGtal/arithmetic/LighterSternBrocot.h"
...
typedef SternBrocot<DGtal::int64_t, DGtal::int32_t, DGtal::StdMapRebinder> SB;
typedef SB::Fraction Fraction;
typedef Fraction::ConstIterator ConstIterator;

Fraction f1( 117, 45 ); // 117/45
Fraction f2; // null 0/0
f2.push_back( std::make_pair( 2, 0 ) ); // u_0 = 2
f2.push_back( std::make_pair( 1, 1 ) ); // u_1 = 1
f2.push_back( std::make_pair( 2, 2 ) ); // u_2 = 2
// f2 = 8/3
// Displays quotients of f1.
for ( ConstIterator it = f1.begin(), itend = f1.end();
      it != itend; ++it )
  std::cout << "u_" << (*it).second 
            << " = " << (*it).first << std::endl;
@endcode

You may have a look at testLighterSternBrocot.cpp to see how to use these fractions.

\section dgtal_irrfrac_sec3 Using irreducible fractions.

\subsection dgtal_irrfrac_sec3_1 Choosing your integers for fractions

Available fractions allows you to choose the ultimate precision 
you wish to have for your fractions.

You have two different integral types for irreducible fractions: TInteger and TSize. 
The type TInteger defines the integral type for the numerators and the denominators.
The type TSize defines the integral type for the quotients and for the depth of the 
fraction. 

\note It is worthy to note that quotients are in general much much smaller than 
numerators and denominators (except for fractions p/1 or 1/q). You may choose 
thus a smaller type for TSize (like DGtal::int32_t) than for TInteger 
(for instance DGtal::int64_t).

You may for instance choose your fractions like:
@code
// With SternBrocot
typedef SternBrocot<DGtal::int64_t,DGtal::int32_t>::Fraction Fraction; // not so big fractions
typedef SternBrocot<DGtal::BigInteger,DGtal::BigInteger>::Fraction Fraction; // arbitrary large fractions

// With LighterSternBrocot
typedef LighterSternBrocot<DGtal::int64_t,DGtal::int32_t,DGtal::StdMapRebinder>::Fraction Fraction; // not so big fractions
typedef LighterSternBrocot<DGtal::BigInteger,DGtal::BigInteger,DGtal::StdMapRebinder>::Fraction Fraction; // arbitrary large fractions
@endcode

\note If you wish to instantiate fractions with integral types
other than DGtal::int32_t, DGtal::int64_t, DGtal::BigInteger, then you 
must instantiate the singleton of the class. For instance, add somewhere
in your code:

@code
// With SternBrocot
typedef SternBrocot<IntegralType1,IntegralType2>::Fraction Fraction; // not so big fractions

template <>
SternBrocot<IntegralType1,IntegralType2>*
SternBrocot<IntegralType1,IntegralType2>::singleton = 0;
@endcode

\note In some sense, \e IntegralType2 should be promotable to \e IntegralType1. 
I.e., if \e t1 is of type \e IntegralType1 and \e t2 is of type \e IntegralType2 then

@code
t1 = (IntegralType1) t2; 
@endcode
should be valid.

\subsection dgtal_irrfrac_sec3_2 Instantiating fractions

You may instantiate a fraction directly by giving the numerator \e p and denominator \e q. 
Note that if \f$ g = gcd(p,q) \neq 1 \f$, the instantiated fraction is \f$ \frac{p'}{q'} \f$ 
where \f$ p'=p/g, q'=q/g \f$. We follow the example convergents.cpp.

First we give the correct includes:

@snippet arithmetic/convergents.cpp convergents-basicIncludes

Then the useful types:

@snippet arithmetic/convergents.cpp convergents-types

The program is given \e p and \e q in arguments \e argv. The fraction is
instantiated as follows:

@snippet arithmetic/convergents.cpp convergents-instantiation

\subsection dgtal_irrfrac_sec3_3 Obtaining quotients

You may visit the quotients of a fraction by using the single-pass iterators
provided by the class. A fraction is indeed a model of CSinglePassConstRange.
The quotients are computed and stored with the call to \c begin(). We therefore
advise you to store the begin() iterator in a variable. Then, all other
operations with iterators (copy, displacement, comparison, dereferenciation) are O(1).
We display the quotients of the fraction \e f as follows.

@snippet arithmetic/convergents.cpp convergents-cfrac

\note The iterator value is the pair \f$ (u_i,i) \f$ where \f$ 0 \le i \le k \f$ 
and \e k is the depth of the fraction. The type is therefore a \c std::pair<Size,Size>.
This is done for consistency with \c push_back method.

\subsection dgtal_irrfrac_sec3_3_bis Obtaining all the convergents of a fraction

One way of obtaining all the convergents of a fraction is simply to create the fraction
progressively by adding quotients one at a time. You may use the methods \c pushBack or \c push_back 
to do so. This can be done as follows:

@snippet arithmetic/convergents.cpp convergents-convergents

You may now execute this program to get the quotients and the convergents of a 
given fraction. We give below several examples:

@verbatim
# A Fibonacci fraction
$ ./examples/arithmetic/convergents 21 34
z = [0,1,1,1,1,1,1,2]
z_0 = 0 / 1
z_1 = 1 / 1
z_2 = 1 / 2
z_3 = 2 / 3
z_4 = 3 / 5
z_5 = 5 / 8
z_6 = 8 / 13
z_7 = 21 / 34

# Approximations of pi
$ ./examples/arithmetic/convergents 103993 33102
z = [3,7,15,1,292]
z_0 = 3 / 1
z_1 = 22 / 7
z_2 = 333 / 106
z_3 = 355 / 113

\subsection dgtal_irrfrac_sec3_4 Fractions are back insertable

Since fractions have a \c push_back method, you can use \c std::back_inserter 
to create a \c std::back_insert_iterator on your fraction. The code
for computing a fraction from its quotients looks like: 

@see fraction.cpp

@snippet arithmetic/fraction.cpp fraction-from-quotients

which gives

@verbatim
# More precise approximation of pi
$ ./examples/arithmetic/fraction 3 7 15 1 292 1 1 1 2 1 3 1 14
z = 80143857 / 25510582
@endverbatim

\subsection dgtal_irrfrac_sec3_5 Computing reduced fractions

If \f$ z_k \f$ is a fraction, its 1-reduced is \f$ z_{k-1} \f$, its 2-reduced is \f$ z_{k-2} \f$
and so on. Reduced are in particular used for computing Bézout vectors, or in splitting formulas.
You may use the methods \c reduced (SternBrocot::Fraction::reduced, 
LighterSternBrocot::Fraction::reduced) or \c partial (SternBrocot::Fraction::partial,
LighterSternBrocot::Fraction::partial) to obtain them.

Assume \e f is the fraction \f$ 103993 / 33102 = [3;7,15,1,292] \f$. Then
@code
Fraction z_3 = f.reduced( 1 ); // [3;7,15,1] but in fact [3;7,16]
Fraction z_2 = f.reduced( 2 ); // [3;7,15] 
@endcode

\note The depth of a \e i-reduced fraction is necessarily \f$ k - i \f$.
It may be \f$ k - i - 1 \f$.

You dispose also of the methods \c getSplit and \c getSplitBerstel to obtain directly
the decomposition of a fraction into two fractions. Their "mediant sum" gives the fraction itself.
Fractions are seen as vectors in this case.

@see SternBrocot::Fraction::getSplit, LighterSternBrocot::Fraction::getSplit,
SternBrocot::Fraction::getSplitBerstel, LighterSternBrocot::Fraction::getSplitBerstel.

\subsection dgtal_irrfrac_sec3_6 Getting ancestors in the Stern-Brocot tree

Convergents or partials, and reduced fractions are ancestors of a given fractions. 
There exist in-between ancestors which are not given by these methods. We list them below
with their exact definition, assuming \e f is \f$ [u_0,...,u_{k-1},u_k] \f$:

- \e i-\b convergent or \e i-\b partial: the fraction \f$ z_i=[u_0,...,u_i] \f$.
  Method \c partial,  SternBrocot::Fraction::partial, LighterSternBrocot::Fraction::partial.
- \e i-\b reduced fraction: the fraction \f$ z_{k-i}=[u_0,...,u_{k-i}] \f$.
  Method \c reduced,  SternBrocot::Fraction::reduced, LighterSternBrocot::Fraction::reduced.
- \b father fraction: the fraction \f$ z'=[u_0,...,u_{k-1},u_{k} - 1] \f$.
  Method \c father,  SternBrocot::Fraction::father, LighterSternBrocot::Fraction::father.
- \e m-\b father fraction: the fraction \f$ z'=[u_0,...,u_{k-1},m] \f$.
  Method \c father(Size m),  SternBrocot::Fraction::father(Size m) const, LighterSternBrocot::Fraction::father(Size m) const.
- \b origin fraction: the fraction \f$ z'=[u_0,...,u_{k-1},1] \f$.
  Method \c origin,  SternBrocot::Fraction::origin, LighterSternBrocot::Fraction::origin.

\subsection dgtal_irrfrac_sec3_7 Inverse of a fraction

You can get the inverse of a fraction in O(1) with the
method \c inverse (SternBrocot::Fraction::inverse, LighterSternBrocot::Fraction::inverse).

\subsection dgtal_irrfrac_sec3_8 Rational approximation of floating-point number

A simple way to get rational approximation of a "real" number is to
use the mapping: \f$ G(x)=\frac{1}{x- \lfloor x \rfloor} \f$. The
successive \f$ \lfloor x \rfloor \f$ gives the successive quotients of
the rational approximation. You may have a look at example
approximation.cpp.

@snippet arithmetic/approximation.cpp approximation-process


\subsection dgtal_irrfrac_sec3_9 Standard arithmetic operations '+', '-', '*', '/'

There are not implemented yet and continued fractions are not the best
representation for doing them. Here, you must use numerators and
denominators to perform computations with these fractions.

\todo Arithmetic operations will soon be implemented with usual
arithmetic operations on numerators and denominators. Furthermore, a
dedicated system for performing arithmetic operations using only
quotients (and guaranteed O(log(k)) complexity) is also under
development.
