@writers Jacques-Olivier Lachaud

Part of the \ref packageArithmetic.

This module gathers classes and functions to represent lattice
polytopes in 2D (otherwise saide, convex polygons with vertices at
integer coordinates) and digital half-spaces. The main part of the
module is the class LatticePolytope2D, which represents these
polytopes. This module is a possible solution for solving \b integer \b
linear \b programming in the \b plane. It is thus the basis for the
COBA algorithm for \b recognizing \b digital \b planes (see
COBANaivePlane).

\section dgtal_lattice_polytope_2d_sec1 Creating a lattice polytope in Z2

The class LatticePolytope2D represents an arbitary convex polygon
in the 2D plane whose vertices have integer coordinates. It is
parameterized by a digital space \a TSpace (a model of CSpace with
dimension 2) and by the container class \a TSequence for storing
vertices (a model of [boost::Sequence
http://www.sgi.com/tech/stl/Sequence.html] over TSpace::Point, default
is std::list<TSpace::Point>). The class LatticePolytope2D contains as a data member some \a TSequence instance and you may use all the standard
methods of sequences. All the useful data of a LatticePolytope2D are in
the \a TSequence data member.

The class LatticePolytope2D is a model of <a
href="http://www.sgi.com/tech/stl/Sequence.html">boost::Sequence</a>,
but also of boost::DefaultConstructible, boost::CopyConstructible,
boost::Assignable. This class is also a model of
CDrawableWithBoard2D. You may therefore display it on a Board2D
object. 

Since a sequence is ordered, its order defines the order of vertices
along the polygon, i.e. any vertex in the sequence forms an edge with
the previous vertex and another edge with the next vertex. Note that
the vertices must follow the \b clockwise ordering, i.e. the inside of
the polygon is to the right-hand side when moving along the polygon. The
following example defines a triangle in the standard limited integer
planes Z2i::Z2 (integer coordinates are \c int32_t):

@code
#include "DGtal/arithmetic/LatticePolytope2D.h"
using namespace Z2i;
...
typedef LatticePolytope2D<Z2> CIP;
CIP triangle;
triangle.push_front( Point( 0, 0 ) );
triangle.push_front( Point( 0, 7 ) );
triangle.push_front( Point( 10, 0 ) );
@endcode

\note This class contains a mutable object IntegerComputer as well as
several other mutable members to perform computations efficiently (see
dgtal_integer_computations). However these private data members are
not copied nor assigned. They exists so as to avoid memory managements
when using big integers.

You may use any insertion/deletion methods of a sequence (insert,
erase, push_back, push_front, etc). Be careful however, in order that
the object has a correct behaviour in more elaborate methods like
LatticePolytope2D::cut() or LatticePolytope2D::findCut, you must
enforce that inserted or deleted vertices leave the polytope convex.

\section dgtal_lattice_polytope_2d_sec2 Displaying 2D lattice polytopes

A LatticePolytope2D is a model of CDrawableWithBoard2D. Therefore
it is displayable on a Board2D with the operator \c <<. The following
example displays a square in red over its domain.

@snippet arithmetic/lower-integer-convex-hull.cpp lower-integer-convex-hull-instantiation

You may choose colors with the usual CustomStyle / CustomColors
mechanism. Furthermore, choosing Color::None for filling colors allows
to draw only the boundary of the polygon.

\section dgtal_lattice_polytope_2d_sec3 Converting a 2D lattice polytope into a digital set

It is sometimes useful to enumerate all the integer points lying
within the polygon bounds. The method
LatticePolytope2D::getIncludedDigitalPoints() is templated by the
type \a TDigitalSet, which must be a model of CDigitalSet. It modifies
the digital set given in parameter so as to holds these points. For
now, the complexity is not optimal. If \a D is the size of the domain
of \a TDigitalSet, \a N the number of vertices of the polygon, then
the complexity is upper bounded by O(ND log(D)) (if \a TDigitalSet is DigitalSetBySTLSet).

@code
// cip is some lattice polytope
Domain domain = cip.boundingBoxDomain();
DigitalSet aSet( domain );
cip.getIncludedDigitalPoints( aSet );
// aSet contains the digital points inside or on the boundary of the polygon.
board << aSet; // displays them.
@endcode

\section dgtal_lattice_polytope_2d_sec4 Basic services: vertices, centroid, area

Since a LatticePolytope2D is a sequence, you may iterate over the
vertices with the usual LatticePolytope2D::begin()and
LatticePolytope2D::end(), with two versions of iterators (Iterator
and ConstIterator). To know if the polygon has no vertices, it is
faster to use LatticePolytope2D::empty(). Otherwise you may obtain
the following information:

- number of vertices: LatticePolytope2D::size()

- the double of the area, which is an integer:
  LatticePolytope2D::twiceArea()

- the exact centroid of the polygon as a triplet of integers (x,y,g),
  where the centroid rational coordinates are (x/g,y/g):
  LatticePolytope2D::centroid().

A LatticePolytope2D \a P may have zero area (in this case it has at
most two vertices).  Thanks to Pick formula, you can also get the
exact number \a b of points on the boundary and the exact number \a i
of points in the interior of the polygon: \f$ A(P) = i + b/2 - 1 \f$.

- number of interior points: LatticePolytope2D::numberInteriorPoints
- number of boundary points: LatticePolytope2D::numberBoundaryPoints

\section dgtal_lattice_polytope_2d_sec5 Polygon edges define half-planes

A lattice polytope polygon may be defined by a list of vertices (with some
properties) but also as the intersection of half-planes. For instance,
if \f$ (v_i)_{i=0..n-1} \f$ are the vertices of the polytope, then the
polytope is also the intersection of the half-planes which contains the
polytope centroid and whose boundary contains edges
\f$(v_i,v_{i+1})\f$.

You may use the following methods:

- to get the half-plane defined by an edge:
  LatticePolytope2D::halfSpace() with an iterator on the first
  vertex.

- to get an arbitrary half-plane defined by three points (two on the
  boundary, one inside): LatticePolytope2D::halfSpace( const Point & A, const Point & B, const Point & inP ) const.

- Given some half-plane, finds the edges/vertices of this polygon that
  crosses/borders this half-plane:
  LatticePolytope2D::findCut(). Also returns the number of
  vertices inside the half-plane.


\section dgtal_lattice_polytope_2d_sec6 Cutting the polygon by half-planes

You may also update a LatticePolytope2D by intersecting it with
half-planes, i.e. linear constraints of the form ax+by <= c. The
polygon is updated so that all its vertices have integer coordinates
and the constraints are fulfilled. This means for instance that a set
of linear constraints may have a non-empty interior (in the Euclidean
space sense), but the resulting polygon may be empty or have an empty
interior. However, it is guaranteed that all integer solutions are
kept.

This snippet is taken from example lower-integer-convex-hull.cpp. It
cuts the polygon by calling LatticePolytope2D::cut. An half-plane
is specified beforehands by instantiating a
LatticePolytope2D::HalfSpace. Note that it is a redefinition of the
class ClosedIntegerHalfPlane.

   This example shows how to create a LatticePolytope2D that
   represents a square. Then given integer parameters \a a, \a b, \a
   c, it cuts the polygon by the half-plane \f$ ax+by \le c \f$. It
   also outputs some statistics.
