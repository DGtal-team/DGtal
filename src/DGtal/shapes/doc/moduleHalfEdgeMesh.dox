Part of \ref packageTopology and  \ref packageShapes
  
This part of the manual describes how to represent combinatorial
surfaces, generally embedded in \f$\mathbb{R}^3\f$. The underlying
combinatorial topological structure is the classical half-edge data
structure (or doubly connected cell list). We also provide a
triangulated surface representation that is based on an half-edge data
structure. A more general polygonal surface is provided and is also
based on the same half-edge data sructure. In the latter case, faces
of the surface can be arbitrary simple polygons.

\section HEM_sec1 The half-edge data structure

A half-edge data structure is a way to represent the topology of a
combinatorial surface. A combinatoirial surface is a union of
vertices, edges (a curve bordered by two vertices), faces (a piece of
surface bordered by a sequence of edges). They are often called
0-cells, 1-cells and 2-cells respectively. The half-edge data
structure describes which cells are connected to each other. Its
principle is to associate two \em half-edges to each edge. Once this is
done, it is easy to tie cells together by simply indicating for each
half-edge:

- its next half-edge (along its face)
- its opposite half-edge (along the edge, that the half-edge associated to the neighboring face)
- its associated face
- its associated vertex (here, we choose the "to" vertex if the half-edge is seen as an arc)
- its associated edge

The classical half-edge data structure is implemented in the class HalfEdgeDataStructure.

@note Large parts of this class are taken from
https://github.com/yig/halfedge, written by Yotam Gingold.
 

\subsection HEM_sec1_1 Creating a half-edge data structure

For now, you only have methods to create a half-edge data structure
from a set of triangles and edges. For instance, the following code
builds a half-edge data structure representing two triangles tied
along one edge:

\code
  #include "DGtal/topology/HalfEdgeDataStructure.h"
  ...
  std::vector< Triangle > triangles( 2 );
  triangles[0].v = { 0, 1, 2 };
  triangles[1].v = { 2, 1, 3 };

  HalfEdgeDataStructure mesh;
  mesh.build( triangles );
\endcode

All elements within the half-edge data structure are numbered,
starting from 0. Furthermore, the indices of vertices and triangles
are the same as the one given at initialization. 

So, for instance, in the code above, triangle 0 is incident to
vertices 0, 1, 2 and triangle 1 is incident to vertices 2, 1, 3.

@note Unordered edges may also be numbered according to your
preference, but you need to call the other
HalfEdgeDataStructure::build method, which takes as input triangles \b
and edges, not only triangles. In this case, this other method builds
a half-edge structure that keeps both the numbering of triangles and
edges.

\subsection HEM_sec1_2 Elementary operations

Since half-edges are the basis of the structure, you have operations
to get a half-edge from an arc (i.e. a couple of vertices), or from
neighboring vertices or faces:

- HalfEdgeDataStructure::halfEdgeIndexFromArc : given an arc or two
  vertices, returns the corresponding half-edge index (logarithmic
  cost in the number of half-edges)

- HalfEdgeDataStructure::halfEdgeIndexFromVertexIndex,
  HalfEdgeDataStructure::halfEdgeIndexFromFaceIndex,
  HalfEdgeDataStructure::halfEdgeIndexFromEdgeIndex: returns the index
  of a half-edge that borders the given vertex, face or edge
  (constant time operation)

- HalfEdgeDataStructure::halfEdge : given a half-edge index, returns
  the half-edge itself.
 
Then, each half-edge can give you its associated vertex, face, edge, opposite and next half-edge:

- HalfEdgeDataStructure::HalfEdge::toVertex : the end vertex of this
  half-edge as an index into the vertex array.
- HalfEdgeDataStructure::HalfEdge::face : index of the associated
  face into the face array.
- HalfEdgeDataStructure::HalfEdge::edge : index of the associated edge into the edge array.
- HalfEdgeDataStructure::HalfEdge::opposite : index of the opposite
  half-edge into the half-edge array.
- HalfEdgeDataStructure::HalfEdge::next index of the next half-edge
  along the face into the half-edge array.

\image html half-edge-data-structure.png "Illustration of half-edge data structure: each edge corresponds to two half-edges with opposite direction. You have access to the next half-edge along the face or to your opposite half-edge. You can also retrieve your associated face or vertex."

Finally a half-edge data structure can give you all the necessary
neighboring information, and can also list the vertices and arcs that
lie on the boundary of the data structure:

- HalfEdgeDataStructure::neighboringVertices,
  HalfEdgeDataStructure::getNeighboringVertices : returns the sequence
  of vertices that are neighbors to the given vertex. The order of
  neighbors has meaning and corresponds to the order given at the
  initialization per triangle.

- HalfEdgeDataStructure::neighboringFaces,
  HalfEdgeDataStructure::getNeighboringFaces : returns the sequence of
  faces that are incident to the given vertex.  The order of
  neighbors has meaning and corresponds to the order given at the
  initialization per triangle.

- HalfEdgeDataStructure::boundaryVertices,
  HalfEdgeDataStructure::boundaryHalfEdgeIndices,
  HalfEdgeDataStructure::boundaryArcs : returns the vertices and/or
  arcs lying on the boundary of the combinatorial surface (in no
  particular order).

\subsection HEM_sec1_3 Details about internal representation

It is worthy to note the following elements in this representation:

- half-edges, vertices, edges and faces are numbered consecutively from 0.
- vertices and faces (here triangles) keep their numbering given at initialization.
- given a vertex index, an edge index, or a face index, you can get
  an half-edge incident to it in constant time (stored as a vector).
- given an arc (i.e. a couple of vertices), you can get the
  corresponding half-edge in logarithmic time (stored as a map).


\subsection HEM_sec1_4 Modifying operations: flip, split, merge

Since 1.1, there is a limited support for classical flip, split and
merge operations. For now, it is limited to triangulated half-edge
date structures, i.e. a face is bordered by three half-edges. 

- HalfEdgeDataStructure::isFlippable tells if some edge is flippable,
  i.e. it is bordered by two valid triangles;
- HalfEdgeDataStructure::flip flips the given edge if the edge is
  flippable, so that the edge now connects the two other vertices of
  the bordering two triangles;
- HalfEdgeDataStructure::split splits the given edge if the edge is
  flippable, i.e. creates a new vertex on this edge and two new
  triangles;
- HalfEdgeDataStructure::isMergeable tells if some edge is mergeable,
  i.e. (1) it is bordered by two triangles, (2) there is no boundary
  vertex in the two triangles bordering the edge;
- HalfEdgeDataStructure::merge merges the given edge and the two
  bordering triangles, leaving only one vertex and two edges, only if
  the edge is mergeable.

There is also a method HalfEdgeDataStructure::isValid that performs a
lot of checks on the validity of the data structure.

@note Methods HalfEdgeDataStructure::isFlippable and
HalfEdgeDataStructure::isMergeable has \f$ O(1) \f$ time complexity. Methods
HalfEdgeDataStructure::flip, HalfEdgeDataStructure::split and
HalfEdgeDataStructure::merge have \f$ O(1) \f$ time complexity when
optimization parameter `update_arc2index` is `false`, and \f$ O(\log
n) \f$ time complexity otherwise, where \f$ n \f$ stands for the
number of half-edges.


\section HEM_sec2 A triangulated surface data structure

A \b triangulated \b surface is a two-dimensional simplicial complex,
with a piecewise linear geometry. We use the half-edge data structure
to represent its topology and its geometry is simply given by
precising coordinates for each vertex. The class TriangulatedSurface
represents this geometric object. You may also associate other
information to each vertex of the surface, through
TriangulatedSurface::VertexPropertyMap objects. 

A triangulated surface is a model of graph
(concepts::CUndirectedSimpleGraph) so you may use graph
algorithms to traverse it (see \ref moduleGraphDefinitions).

\subsection HEM_sec2_1 Building a triangulated surface

A triangulated surface is parameterized by the type that represents
the coordinates of each vertex. Then you simply add vertices by
specifying their coordinates, and triangles by giving the indices of
the three vertices counterclockwise. Once this is done, you must call
TriangulatedSurface::build to finish the construction. The following
code creates a tetrahedron.

\code
// The following includes and type definitions will be used everywhere afterwards.
#include "DGtal/shapes/TriangulatedSurface.h"

typedef PointVector<3,double>             RealPoint;
typedef TriangulatedSurface< RealPoint >  TriMesh;
typedef TriMesh::VertexRange              VertexRange;
typedef TriMesh::ArcRange                 ArcRange;
typedef TriMesh::Arc                      Arc;
typedef TriMesh::Face                     Face;
typedef TriMesh::Vertex                   Vertex;
typedef TriMesh::PositionsMap             PositionsMap;

TriMesh mesh;
mesh.addVertex( RealPoint( 0, 0, 0 ) ); // vertex 0
mesh.addVertex( RealPoint( 1, 0, 0 ) ); // vertex 1
mesh.addVertex( RealPoint( 0, 1, 0 ) ); // vertex 2
mesh.addVertex( RealPoint( 1, 1, 1 ) ); // vertex 3
mesh.addTriangle( 0, 1, 2 );            // triangle 0
mesh.addTriangle( 3, 1, 0 );            // triangle 1
mesh.addTriangle( 3, 2, 1 );            // triangle 2
mesh.addTriangle( 3, 0, 2 );            // triangle 3
bool ok = mesh.build(); // should be true
\endcode

Note that the topology that ties triangles together is built when
calling TriangulatedSurface::build. If the topology is valid, it
returns true. This method may return false for instance in the
following cases:
- three triangles sharing an edge,
- number of vertices given by triangles does not match the number of vertex coordinates,
- butterfly neighborhoods in the triangulation.

\subsection HEM_sec2_2 Main topological operations

As a model of graph (more precisely concepts::CUndirectedSimpleGraph),
you can get neighbors of vertices, degree and some other operations,
as well as iterators for visiting vertices. As a combinatorial
surfaces you have a lot of other operations to navigate onto the
triangulated surface:

- vertex to vertices: you can get the neighboring vertices with
  TriangulatedSurface::writeNeighbors.

- vertex to arcs: you can get ingoing and outgoing arcs with
  TriangulatedSurface::inArcs and TriangulatedSurface::outArcs. The
  order is significant.

- vertex to faces: you can get the faces incident to the given vertex
  with TriangulatedSurface::facesAroundVertex.

- arc to vertices: you can get the head and the tail of an arc with
  TriangulatedSurface::head and TriangulatedSurface::tail.

- arc to opposite arc: with TriangulatedSurface::opposite.

- arc to face: you can get the only face incident to the given arc
  with TriangulatedSurface::faceAroundArc (may be invalid) or as a
  sequence of zero or one face with
  TriangulatedSurface::facesAroundArc.

- face to vertices: you can get the sequence of vertices incident to a
  given face with TriangulatedSurface::verticesAroundFace, in the same
  order as the sequence of incident arcs along the face. Here, it
  returns three vertices.

- face to arcs: you can get the sequence of 3 arcs incident to a
  given face with TriangulatedSurface::arcsAroundFace, in the same
  order as the sequence of incident arcs along the face.


Furthermore you can enumerate all the vertices, arcs and faces with
TriangulatedSurface::allVertices, TriangulatedSurface::allArcs,
TriangulatedSurface::allFaces.

\subsection HEM_sec2_3 Boundary of triangulated surface

Some of the edges of the triangulation may not be shared by two
triangles, but only one. This set of edges, which may be organized in
sequences, forms the boundary of the surface, which may be connected
or disconnected. You have some operations to access to the boundary of
the surface:

- TriangulatedSurface::isVertexBoundary tells if some vertex lies on the boundary.
- TriangulatedSurface::isArcBoundary tells if an arc is a boundary arc (its opposite is then not in the boundary)
- TriangulatedSurface::allBoundaryArcs returns the set of all arcs (oriented edges) lying on the
  boundary of the surface (in no particular order).
- TriangulatedSurface::allBoundaryVertices returns the set of vertices lying on the boundary of the
  surface (in no particular order).

\subsection HEM_sec2_4 Helpers to convert triangulated surfaces from/to mesh

File MeshHelpers.h provides two methods to convert a Mesh into a
TriangulatedSurface and conversely.

- MeshHelpers::mesh2TriangulatedSurface builds a triangulated surface (class TriangulatedSurface)
  from an arbitrary mesh (class Mesh). Since a mesh may have non triangular faces,
  they are then triangulated naively (triangles (0,1,2), (0,2,3), (0,3,4),
  etc).

- MeshHelpers::triangulatedSurface2Mesh Builds a mesh (class Mesh)
  from a triangulated surface (class TriangulatedSurface). Note that
  the mesh looses the topology of the triangulated surface, since it
  is essentially a soup of triangles. It is useful for display or for
  export to OBJ format for instance.

- MeshHelpers::digitalSurface2DualTriangulatedSurface builds a
  triangulated surface (class TriangulatedSurface) from the dual graph
  of a digital surface (class DigitalSurface). It is for instance
  useful for building an isosurface.

You may have a look at example shapes/viewMarchingCubes.cpp to see an
example of using MeshHelpers::digitalSurface2DualTriangulatedSurface and
MeshHelpers::triangulatedSurface2Mesh.

\subsection HEM_sec2_5 Geometrical operations

The class TriangulatedSurface just come with a way to get/set the
position of each vertex:

- TriangulatedSurface::position : setter/getter of position given a vertex index.

\subsection HEM_sec2_6 Associating data to vertices, edges, faces

The easiest way to associate data to vertices, edges or faces is to
create a relevant TriangulatedSurface::IndexedPropertyMap. In fact,
this is the mechanism used by the class TriangulatedSurface to store
positions. The lines below show how to build a map associated an
integer to each face:

\code
TriangulatedSurface<RealPoint> mesh;
...
auto face_normal_map = mesh.makeFaceMap<int>( 0 ); // 0 is default value
for ( int i = 0; i < mesh.nbFaces(); ++i )
{
  face_normal_map[ i ] = i; // each face is labelled with its own index.
}
\endcode

Any TriangulatedSurface::IndexedPropertyMap is in fact a vector of
value, the size of which depends on the number of vertices / edges /
face. We exploit the fact that vertices, edges and faces are all
numbered consecutively starting from 0. The following methods returns
property maps:

- TriangulatedSurface::makeVertexMap<T> : creates a map associating a value of type T to each vertex. 
- TriangulatedSurface::makeEdgeMap<T> : creates a map associating a value of type T to each edge.
- TriangulatedSurface::makeFaceMap<T> : creates a map associating a value of type T to each face.
- TriangulatedSurface::positions : returns an alias to the map giving the position of each vertex.

\subsection HEM_sec2_7 Triangulated surface I/O and visualization

You have methods to export a triangulated surface as an OBJ file:
MeshHelpers::exportOBJ or the more complete
MeshHelpers::exportOBJwithFaceNormalAndColor.

In its present form, class TriangulatedSurface does not provide any
visualization methods. However it is simpler to convert a
TriangulatedSurface to/from a Mesh for I/O or for visualization (see
\ref HEM_sec2_4).


You may input or output a Mesh as an OFF/OFS/OBJ file, see \ref
subsect2moduleMeshIO.  More precisely, class MeshWriter allows you to
output a Mesh as an OFF/OFS/OBJ file while class MeshReader can input
an OFF/OFS file into a Mesh.

For visualization, you may also directly stream a Mesh into a Viewer3D.

\code
#include "DGtal/shapes/TriangulatedSurface.h"
#include "DGtal/shapes/Mesh.h"
#include "DGtal/shapes/MeshHelpers.h"
...
  typedef TriangulatedSurface< RealPoint >                TriMesh;
  typedef Mesh< RealPoint >                               ViewMesh;

  // Creates two triangles glued together.
  TriMesh tmesh;
  tmesh.addVertex( RealPoint( 0, 0, 0 ) );
  tmesh.addVertex( RealPoint( 1, 0, 0 ) );
  tmesh.addVertex( RealPoint( 0, 1, 0 ) );
  tmesh.addVertex( RealPoint( 1, 1, 1 ) );
  tmesh.addTriangle( 0, 1, 2 );
  tmesh.addTriangle( 2, 1, 3 );
  tmesh.build();

  // Convert it to a mesh
  ViewMesh mesh;
  MeshHelpers::triangulatedSurface2Mesh( tmesh, mesh );

  // View it
  Viewer3D<> viewer;
  viewer.show();
  viewer.setLineColor(Color(150,0,0,254));
  viewer << mesh;
  viewer << Viewer3D<>::updateDisplay;
  application.exec();
\endcode


\subsection HEM_sec2_8 Modifying operations: flip, split, merge

Since 1.1, there is a limited support for classical flip, split and
merge operations for triangulated surfaces. 

- TriangulatedSurface::isFlippable tells if some edge is flippable,
  i.e. it is bordered by two valid triangles;
- TriangulatedSurface::flip flips the given edge if the edge is
  flippable, so that the edge now connects the two other vertices of
  the bordering two triangles;
- TriangulatedSurface::split splits the given edge if the edge is
  flippable, i.e. creates a new vertex on this edge and two new
  triangles;
- TriangulatedSurface::isMergeable tells if some edge is mergeable,
  i.e. (1) it is bordered by two triangles, (2) there is no boundary
  vertex in the two triangles bordering the edge;
- TriangulatedSurface::merge merges the given edge and the two
  bordering triangles, leaving only one vertex and two edges, only if
  the edge is mergeable.


@note These methods only checks that these operations are
topologically valid. They do not check if the geometry of the
resulting surface is valid, for instance that there is no
self-intersections.

@note Methods TriangulatedSurface::isFlippable,
TriangulatedSurface::isMergeable, TriangulatedSurface::flip,
TriangulatedSurface::split and TriangulatedSurface::merge have all \f$
O(1) \f$ time complexity.


\section HEM_sec3 A polygonal surface data structure

A \b polygonal \b surface is a two-dimensional simplicial complex,
with a piecewise linear geometry per face. Contrary to class
TriangulatedSurface, faces are not restricted to triangles but may be
arbitrary simple polygons. We use the half-edge data structure to
represent its topology and its geometry is simply given by precising
coordinates for each vertex. The class PolygonalSurface represents
this geometric object. You may also associate other information to
each vertex of the surface, through
PolygonalSurface::VertexPropertyMap objects.

A polygonal surface is a model of graph
(concepts::CUndirectedSimpleGraph) so you may use graph
algorithms to traverse it (see \ref moduleGraphDefinitions).

\subsection HEM_sec3_1 Building a polygonal surface

A polygonal surface is parameterized by the type that represents
the coordinates of each vertex. Then you simply add vertices by
specifying their coordinates, and triangles by giving the indices of
the three vertices counterclockwise. Once this is done, you must call
PolygonalSurface::build to finish the construction. The following
code creates a pyramid.

\code
// The following includes and type definitions will be used everywhere afterwards.
#include "DGtal/shapes/PolygonalSurface.h"

typedef PointVector<3,double>              RealPoint;
typedef PolygonalSurface< RealPoint >      PolyMesh;
typedef PolyMesh::VertexRange              VertexRange;
typedef PolyMesh::ArcRange                 ArcRange;
typedef PolyMesh::Arc                      Arc;
typedef PolyMesh::Face                     Face;
typedef PolyMesh::Vertex                   Vertex;
typedef PolyMesh::PositionsMap             PositionsMap;

PolyMesh mesh;
mesh.addVertex( RealPoint( 0, 0, 0 ) ); // vertex 0
mesh.addVertex( RealPoint( 1, 0, 0 ) ); // vertex 1
mesh.addVertex( RealPoint( 0, 1, 0 ) ); // vertex 2
mesh.addVertex( RealPoint( 1, 1, 0 ) ); // vertex 3
mesh.addVertex( RealPoint( 0.5, 0.5, 1 ) ); // vertex 4
mesh.addTriangle( 0, 1, 4 );            // triangle 0
mesh.addTriangle( 1, 3, 4 );            // triangle 1
mesh.addTriangle( 3, 2, 4 );            // triangle 2
mesh.addTriangle( 2, 0, 4 );            // triangle 3
mesh.addQuadrangle( 1, 0, 2, 3 );       // quadrangle 4
bool ok = mesh.build(); // should be true
\endcode

Note that the topology that ties faces together is built when
calling PolygonalSurface::build. If the topology is valid, it
returns true. This method may return false for instance in the
following cases:
- three faces sharing an edge,
- number of vertices given by faces does not match the number of vertex coordinates,
- butterfly neighborhoods in the triangulation.

\subsection HEM_sec3_2 Main topological operations

As a model of graph (more precisely concepts::CUndirectedSimpleGraph),
you can get neighbors of vertices, degree and some other operations,
as well as iterators for visiting vertices. As a combinatorial

- vertex to vertices: you can get the neighboring vertices with
  PolygonalSurface::writeNeighbors.

- vertex to arcs: you can get ingoing and outgoing arcs with
  PolygonalSurface::inArcs and PolygonalSurface::outArcs. The
  order is significant.

- vertex to faces: you can get the faces incident to the given vertex
  with PolygonalSurface::facesAroundVertex.

- arc to vertices: you can get the head and the tail of an arc with
  PolygonalSurface::head and PolygonalSurface::tail.

- arc to opposite arc: with PolygonalSurface::opposite.

- arc to face: you can get the only face incident to the given arc
  with PolygonalSurface::faceAroundArc (may be invalid) or as a
  sequence of zero or one face with
  PolygonalSurface::facesAroundArc.

- face to vertices: you can get the sequence of vertices incident to a
  given face with PolygonalSurface::verticesAroundFace, in the same
  order as the sequence of incident arcs along the face. It is thus
  the sequence of vertices representing the polygonal face.

- face to arcs: you can get the sequence of arcs incident to a
  given face with PolygonalSurface::arcsAroundFace, in the same
  order as the sequence of incident arcs along the face.

Furthermore you can enumerate all the vertices, arcs and faces with
PolygonalSurface::allVertices, PolygonalSurface::allArcs,
PolygonalSurface::allFaces.

\subsection HEM_sec3_3 Boundary of polygonal surface

Some of the edges of the combinatorial surface may not be shared by two
triangles, but only one. This set of edges, which may be organized in
sequences, forms the boundary of the surface, which may be connected
or disconnected. You have some operations to access to the boundary of
the surface:

- PolygonalSurface::isVertexBoundary tells if some vertex lies on the boundary.
- PolygonalSurface::isArcBoundary tells if an arc is a boundary arc (its opposite is then not in the boundary)
- PolygonalSurface::allBoundaryArcs returns the set of all arcs (oriented edges) lying on the
  boundary of the surface (in no particular order).
- PolygonalSurface::allBoundaryVertices returns the set of vertices lying on the boundary of the
  surface (in no particular order).

\subsection HEM_sec3_4 Helpers to convert polygonal surfaces from/to mesh

File MeshHelpers.h provides two methods to convert a Mesh into a
PolygonalSurface and conversely.

- MeshHelpers::mesh2PolygonalSurface builds a polygonal surface (class PolygonalSurface)
  from an arbitrary mesh (class Mesh). 

- MeshHelpers::polygonalSurface2TriangulatedSurface builds a polygonal
  surface from a triangulated surface (faces are triangulated
  according to parameters).

- MeshHelpers::polygonalSurface2Mesh builds a mesh (class Mesh)
  from a polygonal surface (class PolygonalSurface). Note that
  the mesh looses the topology of the polygonal surface, since it
  is essentially a soup of triangles. It is useful for display or for
  export to OBJ format for instance.

- MeshHelpers::digitalSurface2PrimalPolygonalSurface builds a
  polygonal surface (class PolygonalSurface) from the primal graph of
  a 2-dimensional digital surface in K^3 (class DigitalSurface).

- MeshHelpers::digitalSurface2DualPolygonalSurface builds a
  polygonal surface (class PolygonalSurface) from the dual graph
  of a digital surface (class DigitalSurface). It is for instance
  useful for building an isosurface.

You may have a look at example shapes/viewPolygonalMarchingCubes.cpp to see an
example of using MeshHelpers::digitalSurface2DualPolygonalSurface and
MeshHelpers::polygonalSurface2Mesh.

\subsection HEM_sec3_5 Geometrical operations

The class PolygonalSurface juste come with a way to get/set the
position of each vertex:

- PolygonalSurface::position : setter/getter of position given a vertex index.

\subsection HEM_sec3_6 Associating data to vertices, edges, faces

create a relevant PolygonalSurface::IndexedPropertyMap. In fact,
this is the mechanism used by the class PolygonalSurface to store
positions. The lines below show how to build a map associating an

{
  face_normal_map[ i ] = i; // each face is labelled with its own index.
}
\endcode

Any PolygonalSurface::IndexedPropertyMap is in fact a vector of
value, the size of which depends on the number of vertices / edges /
face. We exploit the fact that vertices, edges and faces are all
numbered consecutively starting from 0. The following methods returns
property maps:

- PolygonalSurface::makeEdgeMap<T> : creates a map associating a value of type T to each edge.
- PolygonalSurface::makeFaceMap<T> : creates a map associating a value of type T to each face.
- PolygonalSurface::positions : returns an alias to the map giving the position of each vertex.

\subsection HEM_sec3_7 Polygonal surface I/O and visualization

You have methods to export a polygonal surface as an OBJ file:
MeshHelpers::exportOBJ or the more complete

In its present form, class PolygonalSurface does not provide any

You may input or output a Mesh as an OFF/OFS/OBJ file, see \ref
subsect2moduleMeshIO.  More precisely, class MeshWriter allows you to
output a Mesh as an OFF/OFS/OBJ file while class MeshReader can input
an OFF/OFS file into a Mesh.

For visualization, you may also directly stream a Mesh into a Viewer3D.
