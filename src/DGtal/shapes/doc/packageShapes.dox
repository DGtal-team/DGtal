@b Package @b Overview


This package contains shape related concepts, models and algorithms.
It provides a generic framework and tools to construct multigrid
shapes in DGtal. More precisely, this package contains analytical
objects (parametric, implicit, from point sets,...) with digitization schemes to
make concrete such objects in a given grid step grid.
