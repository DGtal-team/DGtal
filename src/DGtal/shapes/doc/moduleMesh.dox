\section sectmoduleMesh1 Simple Mesh Class 


The aim of this class is to handle basic simple mesh mainly for
basic tasks such as to import/export/display of digital surface. This class is able
to deal with triangulated, quad or polygonal faces and can include
specific colors to display faces. It also provides several static
tools to generate simple shapes like tubular objects or the 3d surface
from height map.

The mesh object stores explicitly the vertices and each face is represented as a list of vertex indices.       

\subsection subsect2moduleMesh Mesh Construction

To construct a Mesh object you need first to include the associated
header file:

@snippet examples/shapes/mesh3DConstructionAndVisualisation.cpp MeshUseInclude 


Then the mesh construction is very simple, for instance you start
 constructing an empty mesh input and specify if you want to store or
not the vertex colors in the mesh:

@snippet examples/shapes/mesh3DConstructionAndVisualisation.cpp MeshUseMeshConstructor 

Then you can add some vertices mesh:

@snippet examples/shapes/mesh3DConstructionAndVisualisation.cpp MeshUseMeshAddingPoints 


and add  some triangular/quad faces from the vertex indices:

@snippet examples/shapes/mesh3DConstructionAndVisualisation.cpp MeshUseMeshAddingBasicFaces 


You can also insert some polygonal faces by defining a vector containing the vertices of the face:

@snippet examples/shapes/mesh3DConstructionAndVisualisation.cpp MeshUseMeshAddingPolygonalFaces 

An example of mesh construction is given here:  mesh3DConstructionAndVisualisation.cpp and will produce the following faces:

\subsection subsect2moduleMeshIO Mesh IO

The Mesh object is integrated in the main IO framework of DGtal. You
can for instance display a Mesh object directly through a Viewer3d object:

@snippet examples/shapes/mesh3DConstructionAndVisualisation.cpp MeshUseDisplay

(See complete example in mesh3DConstructionAndVisualisation.cpp)

You can also export a mesh by using the MeshWriter class given in the header file:
@snippet tests/io/writers/testMeshWriter.cpp MeshWriterUseIncludes
and export it:
@snippet tests/io/writers/testMeshWriter.cpp MeshWriterUseMeshExport


The mesh import is also simple:

- First add the MeshReader file:
@snippet examples/io/meshFromOFF.cpp includeImportOFF

- import the mesh:
@snippet examples/io/meshFromOFF.cpp ImportOFFfile




\section sectmoduleMesh2 Generating Basic Mesh 


The Mesh class also provides some methods to generate shape mesh
associated to tubular object or 3d surface from height map.

For instance you can first define the  vector of the 3D skeleton points:
@snippet tests/shapes/testMesh.cpp testMeshCreateSkeleton

Then you can reconstruct a tubular mesh with a given radius:
@snippet tests/shapes/testMesh.cpp testMeshCreateTubeMesh

You will obtain such a tube display:
   \image html  testMeshVisu3d.png  "Resulting mesh of tubular object."
   \image latex testMeshVisu3d.png  "Resulting mesh of tubular object."  width=5cm



Another example is given in testMesh.cpp which generates an height
field from a sequence of height values. In the same way than the previous
example, you can construct your input height vector:

@snippet tests/shapes/testMesh.cpp testMeshCreateHeightSequence

and then construct the height field mesh:

@snippet tests/shapes/testMesh.cpp testMeshCreateSequenceMesh


You will obtain such a small height field display (with previous tube mesh):

   \image html  testMeshVisu3dBis.png  "Resulting mesh of tubular object and height field."
   \image latex testMeshVisu3dBis.png  "Resulting mesh of tubular object and height field."  width=5cm

@see  tests/shapes/testMesh.cpp
