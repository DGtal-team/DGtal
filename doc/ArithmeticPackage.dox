@b Package @b Overview

This package gathers tools to perform arithmetic
computations. Standard arithmetic computations are provided: greatest
common divisor, Bézout vectors, continued fractions, convergent,
intersection of integer half-spaces. Several representations of
irreducible fractions are provided. They are based on the Stern-Brocot
tree structure. With these fractions, amortized constant time
operations are provided for computing reduced fractions. A
representation of digital standard line in the first quadrant is
provided, as well as fast algorithms to recognize digital straight
subsegments. Furthermore, since 0.6, it provides classes for
representing 2D lattice polytopes (convex integer polygons) as well as
methods to perform linear integer programming in the plane.

Parts of this package are backports from
[ImaGene](https://gforge.liris.cnrs.fr/projects/imagene): class
IntegerComputer, class SternBrocot (written with Xavier Provençal),
algorithms StandardDSLQ0::smartDSS and StandardDSLQ0::reversedSmartDSS
(written with Mouhammad Said), class ConvexIntegerPolygon (written
with Emilie Charrier), class COBANaivePlane (written with Emilie
Charrier and Lilian Buzer).
