@page HowToUseDGtal How to use DGtal in my own project ?
@author David Coeurjolly



Once you have installed the DGtal library, this documentation
describes the ways to link your project and the installed DGtal libs
and making sure that the dependencies are correct. Two main tools will be described:

-# \ref HowToUseDGtal_CMAKE
-# \ref HowToUseDGtal_QMAKE


Let us consider the following helloworld project with the C++ file
\em helloworld.cpp :

@code
#include <DGtal/base/Common.h>

int main(int argc, char** argv)
{
  
  DGtal::trace.info() << "Helloworld from DGtal ";
  DGtal::trace.emphase() << "(version "<< DGTAL_VERSION << ")"<< std::endl;
  
  return 0;
}
@endcode

This simple example just use the "trace" mechanism in DGtal but it
requires @em helloworld.cpp to be linked to DGtal.

\section HowToUseDGtal_CMAKE Using cmake tools:

To compile this file with cmake, you have a CMakeLists.txt file that
looks like:
@code
PROJECT(Helloworld)

ADD_EXECUTABLE(helloworld helloworld)

@endcode


When you installed DGtal, cmake created all the configuration
files that you would need to import DGtal settings in your project in the  "${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/share/DGtal/CMake/"
folder. For example on linux/unix systems, standard installation creates configuration
files in /usr/local/share/DGtal/CMake/".

The most important file in this folder is @em DGtalConfig.cmake which
contains everything you need. Just copy (or better, link) this file in
your project source directory. Then, to link helloworld to DGtal, you just have to update the
CMakeLists.txt such that: 

@code
PROJECT(Helloworld)

#Required in DGtal
CMAKE_MINIMUM_REQUIRED(VERSION 2.6)

FIND_PACKAGE(DGtal REQUIRED)
INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES(${DGTAL_INCLUDE_DIRS})
LINK_DIRECTORIES(${DGTAL_LIBRARY_DIRS})

ADD_EXECUTABLE(helloworld helloworld)
TARGET_LINK_LIBRARIES(helloworld ${DGTAL_LIBRARIES})
@endcode

Additionally, you can control the version of the DGtal library with
for example :
@code
FIND_PACKAGE(DGtal 0.3.1 REQUIRED)
@endcode
that will produce an error if your DGtal installed library has an
older version than 0.3.1.



\section HowToUseDGtal_QMAKE Using qmake tools


To use the qmake tools provided by QT you have to edit the
configuration file \em helloworld.pro to specify the use of the DGtal lib:

@code
TEMPLATE = app

LIBS += -lDGtal 
SOURCES += helloworld.cpp
@endcode
 



If you plane to use 3d-viewer features you have to specify it by
adding a definition transmitted to the compiler:

@code
DEFINES += WITH_VISU3D_QGLVIEWER
@endcode

Moreover you also have to specify that you need to link the part of
DGtal containing the 3D features (and add if needed the link with \em
qglviewer ):

@code
LIBS += -lDGtal  -lDGtal-visu3d  -framework qglviewer 
@endcode

}
