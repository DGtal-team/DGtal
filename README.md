Description
===========

DGtal is a generic open source library for Digital Geometry
programming for which the main objective is to structure different
developments from the digital geometry and topology community. The
aims are numerous: make easier the appropriation of our tools for a
neophyte (new PhD students, researchers from other topics,...), permit
better comparisons from new methods with already existing approaches
and to construct a federative project. Another objective of DGtal is
to simplify the construction of demonstration tools to share new
results and potential efficiency of the proposed work.

DGtal is an opensource free software written by researchers and students from the 
DGtal research community. We wish to keep an estimate of the number of persons 
using the library. This is really important for us to justify the ressources spent 
in developing this software. Please, take a few seconds to fill in the registration
