=== DGtal 0.5 ===
Posted on May, 9th, 2012 by David Coeurjolly

Many changes have been pushed to this release with a lot of nice
tools.  Before going into details component by component, we would
like to focus on a couple of new cool features:

  - new arithmetic package (fractions, models of fraction,
    Stern-Brocot, continued fraction,...)
  - new nD DigitalSurface model (collections of (n-1) topological cells
    with many tools/utilities to track surface elements)
  - update of the build system to make easier the use of DGtal in your
    projects.
  - DGtal and DGtalTools
  - many bugfixes..

* Overall  Project

  - In previous DGtal releases, tools were given in the source
    "tools/" folder. In this release, we have chosen to move the
    tools to another GitHub project
    (http://github.com/DGtal-team/DGtalTools) with a specific
    development process. Please have a look to this project to get
    nice tools built upon the DGtal library.

  - cmake scripts and DGtalConfig have been widely updated to make
    easier the use of the library in your own code

  - We are debugging both the code and the scripts to make it compile
    on windows. We still have couple of issues but most of DGtal
    compiles.

  - Again, efforts have been done on the documentation.


* Package Topology:

 - Creation of the graph concept (see Doxygen documentation)

 - Graph tools have been added: breadth first visitor for any model of
   graph

 - Creation of high-level classes to represent several kinds of
   digital surfaces. Surfaces are n-1 dimensional objetcs and may be
   open or closed. There are several models of digital surface
   containers: boundary of a set of points, explicit set of surfels,
   boundary of a digital object defined by a predicate, frontier
   between two regions, light containers that are discovered on
   traversal but not stored explicitly, etc.

 - All these digital surfaces can be manipulated through the same
   object (DigitalSurface), whichever the container.

 - DigitalSurface is a model of a graph whose vertices are the surfels
   and whose arcs are the connections between surfels.

 - Definition of umbrellas over digital surfaces, that forms faces on
   the surface graph.

 - In 3D, digital surface form combinatorial 2-manifolds with boundary

 - Digital surface can be exported in OFF format

 - Several examples using digital surfaces are provided, like
   extracting isosurfaces from images or volume files defining
   surfaces in labelled images.

* Package Algebraic (new package)

 - Definition of n-variate polynomial as a one-dimensional polynomial
   whose coefficients are n-1-variate polynomials. Coefficient ring
   and dimension are templated.

 - Creation of a reader that can transform a string representation of
   multivariate polynomial into such polynomial object. Use
   boost::spirit.

 - Example using package Topology to extract and display implicit
   polynomial surfaces in 3D.

* Package Arithmetic (new package)

 - Standard arithmetic computations are provided: greatest common
   divisor, Bézout vectors, continued fractions,  convergent.

 - Several representations of irreducible fractions are provided. They
   are based on the Stern-Brocot tree structure. With these fractions,
   amortized constant time operations are provided for computing
   reduced fractions.

 - An implementation of patterns and subpatterns is provided, based on
   the irreducible fractions.
 - A representation of digital standard line in the first quadrant is
   provided, as well as fast algorithms to recognize digital straight
   subsegments.


* Package Image

  - Complete refactoring of Images and ImageContainers (more
    consistent design)
  
  - Documentation added

  - Graph of concepts added in the documentation
  

* Package Geometry

  - New SegmentComputer (a.k.a. geometrical primitives to use for
    recognition, curve decomposition,...) : ArithDSS3D (3D DSS), DCA
    (Digital Circular Arcs), CombinatorialDSSS, ...

  - New normal vector field estimation based on elementary normal
    vector convolution in n-D

  - Distance Transformation by Fast Marching Method added.

* Package IO

  - Complete refactoring of the way a DGtal object is displayed in
    boards/viewers. 
 
  - New 2D board  backend: you can export your drawning in TikZ for
    latex includes.
	

=== DGtal 0.4 ===
Posted on September 26, 2011 by David Coeurjolly

	* Global changes:
	   - A better decomposition of DGtal algorithms and
	data structures into packages.
	   - By default, DGtal is built with minimal dependencies.
	   - Concepts and concept checking mechanism have been
	considerably improved.
	
	* Kernel Package: refactoring of Integer types considered in
	DGtal.

	* Topology Package: Interpixel/cellular topological model,
	boundary tracking tools, ...

	* Geometry Package: 
	  - many things have been added in the 1D contour analysis module:
	multi-modal representation of 1D contours and curves (GridCurve facade),
	decomposition/segmentation into primitives, many differential
	estimators added, helpers for multigrid comparison of estimators
	  - multigrid digital set generators from implicit and parametric
	shapes in dimension 2.
	
	* I/O Package: refactoring/enhancements of DGtal boards and
	viewers,  enhancement of 2D boards with libcairo and a new
	Board3Dto2D board has been added.
	

	* Tools: multigrid shapeGenerator/contourGenerator added,
	lengthEstimator/estimatorComparator  added for differential
	estimator multigrid comparison, connected components extraction in
	3D, ...
	  
	* Documentation: User guide has been improved thanks to a
	decomposition of the library into packages.

=== DGtal 0.3.1 ===
Posted on April 4, 2011 by David Coeurjolly
	
	* Quick release due to a build problem on linux. No more feature
	added.
	* Preliminary cellular grid documentation added.
	* Documentation cleanup.



	
=== DGtal 0.3.0 ===
Posted on April 1, 2011 by David Coeurjolly

Beside the DGtal presentation at DGCI 2011, we are pleased to announce a new DGtal release 0.3.0.

New features:

    User-guide added (based on doxygen system)
    Kernel: new concepts and controls to enhance the Interger type management, new iterators (Range/SubRange) on HyperRectDomains.
    Topology: interpixel model added (cells, boundary tracking mechanisms,…)
    Geometry 2D: 2D curve primitive decomposition, tangential cover, convexity/concavity decomposition.
    Geometry nD: reverse Euclidean distance transformation
    Visualisation: stream mechanism to visualize 3D DGtal objects with libQGLViewer (optional)
    Shape generator factory added in nD

BugFixes, enhancements:

    Many bugs have been fixed for this release.
    cmake DGtal dependency checking process is more stable now

Known problems:

    For technical reasons, we haven’t be able to verify that this release also compile on Windows Visual Studio systems (see ticket #87). A new release will fix this problem as soon as possible.
    All open tickets
