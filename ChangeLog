=== DGtal 0.7 ===

*General*
    - The "boost program option library" dependency was removed.
    - DGtal needs boost >= 1.46	

	
*Geometry Package*
    - Generic adapter to transform a metric (model of CMetric) with monotonic (see doc)
      properties to a separable metric (model of CSeparableMetric)
      which can be used in VoronoiMap/DistanceTransformation algorithms.

	
*Shape Package*
    - The class MeshFromPoints was transformed into Mesh (more from shapes/fromPoints to shapes/ directory).
    - Iterator in mesh points and mesh face.



=== DGtal 0.6 ===
 
 *General*
    - Multithread capabilities via OpenMP are now detected during DGtal
      build. Example of usage can be found in the Volumetric module.

 *Documentation*
    - update documentation for boost concepts, so that subconcepts are
      displayed and html reference pages are pointed.
    - package/module documentation files are now in their associated
      package folder (e.g. kernel/doc/ for kernel package related
      documentation pages). The "make doc" command (or "make dox", see
      below) generates the documentation in the "html/" sub-folder of your
      current build folder.
    - latex citations within doxygen documents are now working
 
 *Base Package*
    - correct concept checks for some range concepts.
    - Statistic class moved to math package

 *Kernel Package*
    - digital sets are now also point predicates, update of
      DigitalSetDomain accordingly. As a consequence, SetPredicate is
      now deprecated.

    - new documentation for module digital sets.

 *Arithmetic Package*
    - new class for representing lattice polytopes in 2D (with cut
      operations)
    - bugfix in LighterSternBrocot::Fraction
    - bugfix in ArithmeticalDSS (thanks, Kacper)

 *Image Package*
    - Update on image writers (no colormap required for scalar only writers).
      Documentation updated.
    - New image adapters to adapt both domains and values of an image (ImageAdapter 
      and ConstImageAdapter).
    - several enhancements of the main image concept and its image
      container models

 *Geometry Package*
    - New primitives for digital plane recognition. Naive planes, and
      more generally planes with arbitrary axis-width can be detected
      and recognized incrementally. Based on a COBA algorithm
      implementation, which uses 2D lattice polytopes.
    - Fréchet segment computer added to compute bounded simplifications of
      digital curves for instance.
    - Complete rewritting of volumetric tools by separable processes:
      new generic algorithms (VoronoiMap, PowerMap) and metric
      concepts hierarchy (l_2, l_p, ...p) to efficiently compute
      DistanceTransformation, ReverseDistanceTransformation and
      preliminary medial axis extraction.
    - Separable volumetric tools are now multithread using OpenMP.
    - New curvature estimator in 2D/3D based on integral invariants
      (both mean and gaussian curvatures in 3D).

 *Shape Package*
    - New operators available on digital and Euclidean shapes (Union,
      Intersection, Minus)

 *Topology Package*
    - update documentation for digital surfaces and digital surface
      containers so as to emphasize the fact that the ranges are only
      single-pass.

 *Graph Package*
    - New package gathering graph related structures and algorithms
      (visitors, graph concepts, ...)
    - Add concepts for graph visitors
    - Add boost::graph support for DigitalSurface
    - Add documentation for graph package.

 *Math Package*
    - Exact exponentiation x^p by squaring on O(log p) added
      (BasicMathFunctions::power).

 *For developers*
    - new "make dox" target to only build dox file documentation
      ("make doc" for complete documentation build)

=== DGtal 0.5 ===
Posted on May, 9th, 2012 by David Coeurjolly

Many changes have been pushed to this release with a lot of nice
tools.  Before going into details component by component, we would
like to focus on a couple of new cool features:

  - new arithmetic package (fractions, models of fraction,
    Stern-Brocot, continued fraction,...)
  - new nD DigitalSurface model (collections of (n-1) topological cells
    with many tools/utilities to track surface elements)
  - update of the build system to make easier the use of DGtal in your
    projects.
  - DGtal and DGtalTools
  - many bugfixes..

* Overall  Project

  - In previous DGtal releases, tools were given in the source
    "tools/" folder. In this release, we have chosen to move the
    tools to another GitHub project
    (http://github.com/DGtal-team/DGtalTools) with a specific
    development process. Please have a look to this project to get
    nice tools built upon the DGtal library.

  - cmake scripts and DGtalConfig have been widely updated to make
    easier the use of the library in your own code

  - We are debugging both the code and the scripts to make it compile
    on windows. We still have couple of issues but most of DGtal
    compiles.

  - Again, efforts have been done on the documentation.


* Package Topology:

 - Creation of the graph concept (see Doxygen documentation)

 - Graph tools have been added: breadth first visitor for any model of
   graph

 - Creation of high-level classes to represent several kinds of
   digital surfaces. Surfaces are n-1 dimensional objetcs and may be
   open or closed. There are several models of digital surface
   containers: boundary of a set of points, explicit set of surfels,
   boundary of a digital object defined by a predicate, frontier
   between two regions, light containers that are discovered on
   traversal but not stored explicitly, etc.

 - All these digital surfaces can be manipulated through the same
   object (DigitalSurface), whichever the container.

 - DigitalSurface is a model of a graph whose vertices are the surfels
   and whose arcs are the connections between surfels.

 - Definition of umbrellas over digital surfaces, that forms faces on
   the surface graph.

 - In 3D, digital surface form combinatorial 2-manifolds with boundary

 - Digital surface can be exported in OFF format

 - Several examples using digital surfaces are provided, like
   extracting isosurfaces from images or volume files defining
   surfaces in labelled images.

* Package Algebraic (new package)

 - Definition of n-variate polynomial as a one-dimensional polynomial
   whose coefficients are n-1-variate polynomials. Coefficient ring
   and dimension are templated.

 - Creation of a reader that can transform a string representation of
   multivariate polynomial into such polynomial object. Use
   boost::spirit.

 - Example using package Topology to extract and display implicit
   polynomial surfaces in 3D.

* Package Arithmetic (new package)

 - Standard arithmetic computations are provided: greatest common
   divisor, Bézout vectors, continued fractions,  convergent.

 - Several representations of irreducible fractions are provided. They
   are based on the Stern-Brocot tree structure. With these fractions,
   amortized constant time operations are provided for computing
   reduced fractions.

 - An implementation of patterns and subpatterns is provided, based on
   the irreducible fractions.
 - A representation of digital standard line in the first quadrant is
   provided, as well as fast algorithms to recognize digital straight
   subsegments.


* Package Image

  - Complete refactoring of Images and ImageContainers (more
    consistent design)
  
  - Documentation added

  - Graph of concepts added in the documentation
  

* Package Geometry

  - New SegmentComputer (a.k.a. geometrical primitives to use for
    recognition, curve decomposition,...) : ArithDSS3D (3D DSS), DCA
    (Digital Circular Arcs), CombinatorialDSSS, ...

  - New normal vector field estimation based on elementary normal
    vector convolution in n-D

  - Distance Transformation by Fast Marching Method added.

* Package IO

  - Complete refactoring of the way a DGtal object is displayed in
    boards/viewers. 
 
  - New 2D board  backend: you can export your drawning in TikZ for
    latex includes.
