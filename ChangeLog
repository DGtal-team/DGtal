=== DGtal 0.8 ===

*IO Package*

    - Better handling of materials in Board3D and OBJ exports.
    - New 'basic' display mode for surfels (oriented or not), useful for large digital surface displays (quads instead of 3D prism)


=== DGtal 0.7 ===

*General*

    - Unit tests build is now disabled by default (to turn it on, run cmake with "-DBUILD_TESTING=on")

    - The "boost program option library" dependency was removed.

    - DGtal needs boost >= 1.46.

    - Thanks to new compiler warning option (-Wdocumentation), the doxygen documentation has been considerably improved.

*Base Package*

    - Complete rewriting of Clone, Alias and ConstAlias
      classes. Parameter passing is now documented with a standardized
      method to determine parameters unambiguously. Associated classed
      CowPtr, CountedPtrOrPtr and CountedConstPtrOrConstPtr are now used
      in conjunction with the previous classes.

    - Few improvments in Clock and Trace base classes.

*Kernel Package*

    - Two initialisation methods (initRemoveOneDim and initAddOneDim)
      for the Projector Functor from the BasicPointFunctors class in
      order to simplify the slice images (with example and test in 2D
      slice image extraction from 3D volume file).

    - New basic functors:
	- SliceRotator2D: to rotate 2D Slice images from 3D volume.
	- Point2DEmbedderIn3D: a simple functor to embed in 3d a 2d points (useful to extract 2D image from 3D volume).

    - Sets have been updated to own their domain with a copy-on-write pointer, in order to avoid some inconsistencies.

*Topology Package*

    - Fixing bugs in Object::isSimple for some digital
      topologies. Speed of Object::isSimple has been improved. Homotopic
      thinning is much faster (even without a precomputed simplicity
      table).

    - Objects have been updated to use Clone services.

*Geometry Package*

    - New classes to deal with arithmetical digital straight segments.
      Now the representation of the primitives and their recognition
      along a discrete structure are separated. The unique class ArithmeticalDSS,
      which was a segment computer, has been replaced by mainly three classes:
      ArithmeticalDSL, ArithmeticalDSS and ArithmeticalDSSComputer.
      This is described in a doc page of the geometry package.
      Note that Backward/Forward suffixes have been renamed into Back/Front.
      Moreover, get prefixes for data members accessors have been removed.

    - Generic adapter to transform a metric (model of CMetric) with
      monotonic (see doc) properties to a separable metric (model of
      CSeparableMetric) which can be used in
      VoronoiMap/DistanceTransformation algorithms.

    - New possibility to access the 3 2D ArithmeticDSS object within an
      ArithmeticDSS3d.

    - New local estimator adapter to make easy implementation of locally defined differential
      estimator on digital surfaces.

    - New documentation on local estimators from digital surface
      patches and surfel functors. New normal vector estimator from
      weighted sum of elementary surfel normal vectors added.

    - With an optional binding with CGAL and Eigen3, new curvature and
      normal vector estimators have been added. For instance, you can
      now estimate curvature from polynomial surface fitting (Jet
      Fitting) and Monge forms.

    - Minor improvements in the spherical accumulator.

    - Improvement of integral invariant estimators (better memory footprint, ...).
      They also allow to estimate principal curvatures using Covariance matrix.
      Covariance matrix is also "masks" based, so the computation is efficient.

    - New algorithms to compute the minimal characteristics of a
      Digital Straight Line subsegment in logarithmic time using local
      convex hulls or Farey Fan. Also works when the DSL
      characteristics are not integers.

    - Chord algorithm for (naive) plane recognition and width computation.

    - New organization for computing primitives. Introduction of the concept
      of PrimitiveComputer and specialization. COBA algorithm and Chord algorithm
      are now models of AdditivePrimitiveComputer.

    - Introduction of the primitive ParallelStrip, computed by COBA and Chord algorithms

    - New documentation for planarity decision, plane recognition and width computation.
      Quantitative and qualitative evaluation of COBA and Chord algorithm.

    - Bug fix in COBA algorithm when extending an empty computer with a group of points.

    - add standard plane recognition with adapter classes both for COBA and Chord algorithm.

*Shape Package*

    - The class MeshFromPoints was transformed into Mesh (more from
      shapes/fromPoints to shapes/ directory), iterators on mesh
      points and mesh face.

*Topology Package*

    - The class SCellToMidPoint is now deprecated. Use CanonicSCellEmbedder instead
      to map a signed cell to its corresponding point in the Euclidean space

*IO Package*

    - Complete refactoring of 3D viewers and boards (Viewer3D, Board3DTo2D).
    - New Board3D to export 3D displays to OBJ 3D vector format.
    - A new display of 2D and 3D image in Viewer3D.
    - New reader: HDF5 file with 2D image dataset(s) (8-bit with palette and 24-bit truecolor with INTERLACE_PIXEL).

      image factory and CImageCacheReadPolicy/CImageCacheWritePolicy
      to define the concept describing cache read/write policies.

    - New classes : ImageFactoryFromImage to implement a factory to
      produce images from a "bigger/original" one according to a given
      domain, ImageCache to implement an images cache with 'read and
      write' policies, TiledImageFromImage to implement a tiled image
      from a "bigger/original" one.

    - ImageContainerByITKImage complies with CImage.
      The container has been moved from the DGtal::experimental namespace to
      the main DGtal namespace.

*Graph Package*

    - New graph visitor, which allows to visit a graph according to
      any distance object (like the Euclidean distance to some point).

=== DGtal 0.5 ===
Posted on May, 9th, 2012 by David Coeurjolly

Many changes have been pushed to this release with a lot of nice
tools.  Before going into details component by component, we would
like to focus on a couple of new cool features:

  - new arithmetic package (fractions, models of fraction,
    Stern-Brocot, continued fraction,...)
  - new nD DigitalSurface model (collections of (n-1) topological cells
    with many tools/utilities to track surface elements)
  - update of the build system to make easier the use of DGtal in your
    projects.
  - DGtal and DGtalTools
  - many bugfixes..

* Overall  Project

  - In previous DGtal releases, tools were given in the source
    "tools/" folder. In this release, we have chosen to move the
    tools to another GitHub project
    (http://github.com/DGtal-team/DGtalTools) with a specific
    development process. Please have a look to this project to get
    nice tools built upon the DGtal library.

  - cmake scripts and DGtalConfig have been widely updated to make
    easier the use of the library in your own code

  - We are debugging both the code and the scripts to make it compile
    on windows. We still have couple of issues but most of DGtal
    compiles.

  - Again, efforts have been done on the documentation.


* Package Topology:

 - Creation of the graph concept (see Doxygen documentation)

 - Graph tools have been added: breadth first visitor for any model of
   graph

 - Creation of high-level classes to represent several kinds of
   digital surfaces. Surfaces are n-1 dimensional objetcs and may be
   open or closed. There are several models of digital surface
   containers: boundary of a set of points, explicit set of surfels,
   boundary of a digital object defined by a predicate, frontier
   between two regions, light containers that are discovered on
   traversal but not stored explicitly, etc.

 - All these digital surfaces can be manipulated through the same
   object (DigitalSurface), whichever the container.

 - DigitalSurface is a model of a graph whose vertices are the surfels
   and whose arcs are the connections between surfels.

 - Definition of umbrellas over digital surfaces, that forms faces on
   the surface graph.

 - In 3D, digital surface form combinatorial 2-manifolds with boundary

 - Digital surface can be exported in OFF format

 - Several examples using digital surfaces are provided, like
   extracting isosurfaces from images or volume files defining
   surfaces in labelled images.

* Package Algebraic (new package)

 - Definition of n-variate polynomial as a one-dimensional polynomial
   whose coefficients are n-1-variate polynomials. Coefficient ring
   and dimension are templated.

 - Creation of a reader that can transform a string representation of
   multivariate polynomial into such polynomial object. Use
   boost::spirit.

 - Example using package Topology to extract and display implicit
   polynomial surfaces in 3D.

* Package Arithmetic (new package)

 - Standard arithmetic computations are provided: greatest common
   divisor, Bézout vectors, continued fractions,  convergent.

 - Several representations of irreducible fractions are provided. They
   are based on the Stern-Brocot tree structure. With these fractions,
   amortized constant time operations are provided for computing
   reduced fractions.

 - An implementation of patterns and subpatterns is provided, based on
   the irreducible fractions.
 - A representation of digital standard line in the first quadrant is
   provided, as well as fast algorithms to recognize digital straight
   subsegments.


* Package Image

  - Complete refactoring of Images and ImageContainers (more
    consistent design)

  - Documentation added

  - Graph of concepts added in the documentation


* Package Geometry

  - New SegmentComputer (a.k.a. geometrical primitives to use for
    recognition, curve decomposition,...) : ArithDSS3D (3D DSS), DCA
    (Digital Circular Arcs), CombinatorialDSSS, ...

  - New normal vector field estimation based on elementary normal
    vector convolution in n-D

  - Distance Transformation by Fast Marching Method added.

* Package IO

  - Complete refactoring of the way a DGtal object is displayed in
    boards/viewers.

  - New 2D board  backend: you can export your drawning in TikZ for
    latex includes.
